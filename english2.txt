It is curious that Stephen Koziatek feels almost as though he has to justify his
efforts to give his students a better future。
Mr。 Koziatek is part of something pioneering。 He is a teacher at a New Hampshire high school where learning is not something of books and tests and mechanical memorization，but practical。When did it become accepted wisdom that students should be able to name the 13th president of the United States but be utterly overwhelmed by a broken bike chain?
As Koziatek knows， there is learning in just about everything。 Nothing is necessarily gained by forcing students to learn geometry at a graffitied desk stuck with generations of discarded chewing gum。 They can also learn geometry by assembling a bicycle。
But he’s also found a kind of insidious prejudice。 Working with your hands is seen as almost a mark of inferiority。 Schools in the family of vocational education “have that stereotype。。。that it’s for kids who can’t make it academically，”he says。
On one hand， that viewpoint is a logical product of America’s evolution。 Manufacturing is not the economic engine that it once was。 The job security that the US economy once offered to high school graduates has largely evaporated。 More education is the new principle。 We want more for our kids， and rightfully so。

 
But the headlong push into bachelor’s degrees for all – and the subtle devaluing of anything less – misses an important point: That’s not the only thing the American economy need。 Yes， a bachelor’s degree opens more doors。 But even now， 54 percent of the jobs in the country are middle-skill jobs， such as construction and high-skill manufacturing。 But only 44 percent of workers are adequately trained。
In other words， at a time when the working class has turned the country on its political head， frustrated that the opportunity that once defined America is vanishing， one obvious solution is staring us in the face。 There is a gap in working-class jobs， but the workers who need those jobs most aren’t equipped to do them。 Koziatek’s Manchester school of Technology High School is trying to fill that gap。
Koziatek’s school is a wake-up call。When education becomes one-size-fits-all， it risks overlooking a nation’s diversity of gifts。
21. A broken bike chain is mentioned to show students’ lack of 。 [A] practical ability
[B] academic training
[C] pioneering spirit
[D] mechanical memorization
22. There exists the prejudice that vocational education is for kids who 。 [A] have a stereotyped mind
[B] have no career motivation
[C] are not academically successful [D] are financially disadvantaged
23. We can infer from Paragraph 5 that high school graduates 。 [A] used to have big financial concerns
[B] used to have more job opportunities
[C] are reluctant to work in manufacturing
[D] are entitled to more educational privileges
 
 
24. The headlong push into bachelor‘s degrees for all 。 [A] helps create a lot of middle-skill jobs
[B] may narrow the gap in working-class jobs
[C] is expected to yield a better-trained workforce [D] indicates the overvaluing of higher education
25. The author‘s attitude toward Koziatek’s school can be described as 。 [A] supportive
[B] tolerant
[C] disappointed [D] cautious Text 2
While fossil fuels—still generate roughly 85 percent of the world’s energy supply， it’s clearer than ever that the future belongs to renewable sources such as wind and solar。The move to renewables is picking up momentum around the world: They now account for more than half of new power sources going on line。
Some growth stems from a commitment by governments and farsighted businesses to fund cleaner energy sources。 But increasingly the story is about the plummeting prices of renewables， especially wind and solar。 The cost of solar panels has dropped by 80 percent and the cost of wind turbines by close to one-third in the past eight years。
In many parts of the world renewable energy is already a principal energy source。 In Scotland， for example， wind turbines provide enough electricity to power 95 percent of homes。 While the rest of the world takes the lead， notably China and Europe， the United States is also seeing a remarkable shift。 In March， for the first time， wind and solar power accounted for more than 10 percent of the power generated in the US， reported the US Energy Information Administration。
 
 
President Trump has underlined fossil fuels—especially coal—as the path to economic growth。 In a recent speech in Iowa， he dismissed wind power as an unreliable energy source。 But that message did not play well with many in Iowa， where wind turbines dot the fields and provide 36 percent of the state’s electricity generation—and where tech giants like Microsoft are being attracted by the availability of clean energy to power their data centers。
The question “What happens when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine?” has provided a quick put-down for skeptics。 But a boost in the storage capacity of batteries is making their ability to keep power flowing around the clock more likely。
The advance is driven in part by vehicle manufacturers， who are placing big
bets on battery-powered electric vehicles。 Although electric cars are still a rarity on roads now，this massive investment could change the picture rapidly in coming years。
While there’s a long way to go，the trend lines for renewables are spiking。The pace of change in energy sources appears to be speeding up—perhaps just in time to have a meaningful effect in slowing climate change。 What Washington does—or doesn’t do—to promote alternative energy may mean less and less at a time of a global shift in thought。
26. The word “plummeting”(Line 3， Para。 2) is closest in meaning to 。 [A] stabilizing
[B] changing [C] falling [D] rising
27. According to Paragraph 3， the use of renewable energy in America 。 [A] is progressing notably
[B] is as extensive as in Europe [C] faces many challenges
 
 
[D] has proved to be impractical
28. It can be learned that in Iowa， 。
[A] wind is a widely used energy source
[B] wind energy has replaced fossil fuels
[C] tech giants are investing in clean energy [D] there is a shortage of clean energy supply
29. Which of the following is true about clean energy according to Paragraphs 5&6? [A] Its application has boosted battery storage。
[B] It is commonly used in car manufacturing。
[C] Its continuous supply is becoming a reality。
[D] Its sustainable exploitation will remain difficult。
30. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that renewable energy____。
[A] will bring the USA closer to other countries。
[B] will accelerate global environmental change。
[C] is not really encouraged by the USA government。
[D] is not competitive enough with regard to its cost。

The power and ambition of the giants of the digital economy is
astonishing-Amazon has just announced
upmarket grocery chain Whole Foods
years ago Facebook paid even more
acquire the WhatsApp messaging service，
which doesn‘t have any physical product at all。 What WhatsApp offered Facebook was an intricate and finely detailed web of its users’ friendships and social lives。
 
the purchase of the for $l3.5bn，but two
than that to
 
Facebook promised the European commission then that it would not link phone numbers to Facebook identities， but it broke the promise almost as soon as the deal went through。 Even without knowing what was in the messages， the knowledge of who sent them and to whom was enormously revealing and still could be。 What political journalist， what party whip， would not want to know the makeup of the WhatsApp groups in which Therea May‘s enemies are currently plotting? It may be that the value of Whole Foods to Amazon is not so much the 460 shops it owns， but the records of which customers have purchased what。
Competition law appears to be the only way to address these imbalances of power。 But it is clumsy。 For one thing， it is very slow compared to the pace of Change within the digital economy。 By the time a problem has been addressed and remedied it may have vanished in the marketplace， to be replaced by new abuses of power。 But there is a deeper conceptual problem， too。 Competition law as presently interpreted deals with financial disadvantage to consumers and this is not obvious when the users of these services don‘t pay for them。 The users of their Services are not their customers。That would be the people who buy advertising from them-and Facebook and Google，the two virtual giants，dominate digital advertising to the disadvantage of all other media and entertainment companies。
The product they‘re selling is data， and we， the users， convert our lives to date for the benefit of the digital giants。 Just as some ants farm the bugs called aphids for the honeydew the produce when they feed， so Google farms us for the data that our digital lives yield。 Ants keep predatory insects away from where their aphids feed; Gmail keeps the spamme out of our inboxes。 It doesn’t feel like a human or democratic relationship， even if both sides benefit。

[B] user information [C] physical assets
 
 
[D] quality service

[A] worsen political disputes

[D] mislead the European commission
33. According to the author， competition law 。
[A] should sever the new market powers
[B] may worsen the economic imbalance
[C] should not provide just one legal solution [D] cannot keep pace with the changing market

[C] the services are generally digital
[D] the services are paid for by advertisers

To combat the trap of putting a premium on being busy， Cal Newport， author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World， recommends building a habit of “deep work”-the ability to focus without distraction。
 
 
There are a number of approaches to mastering the art of deep work- be it lengthy retreats dedicated to a specific task; developing a daily ritual; or taking a “journalistic” approach to seizing moment of deep work when you can throughout the day。 Whichever approach， the key is to determine your length of focus time and stick to it。
Newport also recommends “deep scheduling” to combat constant interruptions and get more done in less time。 “At any given point， I should have deep work scheduled for roughly the next mouth。Once on the calendar，I protect this time like I would a doctor’s appointment or important meeting”， he writes。
Another approach to getting more done in less time is to rethink how you priorities your day – in particular how we craft our to-do lists。 Tim Harford， author of Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives， points to a study in the early 1980s that divided undergraduates into two groups: some were advised to set out monthly goals and study activities;others were told to plan activities and goals in much more detail， day by day。
While the researchers assumed that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective when it came to the execution of tasks，they were wrong:the detailed daily plans demotivated students 。Harford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to-do list ineffective， while leaving room for improvisation in such a list can reap the best results。
In order to make the most of our focus and energy， we also need to embrace downtime， or as Newport suggests， “be lazy”。
“Idleness is not just a vacation， an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body ...”[idleness]is， paradoxically， necessary to getting any work done，” he argues。
Srini Pillay， an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School， believes this counterintuitive link between downtime and productivity may be due to
 
 
the may our brains operate。 When our brains switch between being focused and unfocused on a task， they tend to be more efficient。
“What people don’t realise is that in order to complete these tasks they need to use both the focus and unfocus circuits in their brain，” says Pillay。
36. The key to mastering the art of deep work is to 。 [A] keep to your focus time
[B] list your immediate tasks [C] make specific daily plans [D] seize every minute to work
37. The study in the early 1980s cited by Harford shows that 。 [A] distractions may actually increase efficiency。 [B] daily schedules are indispensable to studying
[C] students are hardly motivated by monthly goals
[D] detailed plans may not be as fruitful as expected
38. According to Newport， idleness is 。
[A] a desirable mental state for busy people。 [B] a major contributor to physical health
[C] an effective way to save time and energy
[D] an essential factor in accomplishing any work
39. Pillay believes that our brains’ shift between being focused and unfocused 。 [A] can result in psychological well-being
[B] can bring about greater efficiency
[C] is aimed at better balance in work
[D] is driven by task urgency
40. This text is mainly about 。
[A] ways to relieve the tension of busy life
 
 
[B] approaches to getting more done in less time [C] the key to eliminating distractions
[D] the cause of the lack of focus time

People have speculated for centuries about a future without work.Today is no different， with academics， writers， and activists once again 1 that technology is replacing human workers.

A different and not mutually exclusive 3 holds that the future will be a wasteland of a different sort，one 4 by purposelessness:Without jobs to give their lives 5 ，people will simply become lazy and depressed. 6 today’s unemployed don’t seem to be having a great time.

Every Saturday morning, at 9 am, more than 50,000 runners set off to run 5km around their local park. The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired 400 events in the UK and more abroad. Events are free, staffed by thousands of volunteers. Runners range from four years old to grandparents; their times range from Andrew Baddeley's world record 13 minutes 48 seconds up to an hour.
Parkrun is succeeding where London's Olympic "legacy" is failing. Ten years ago on Monday, it was announced that the Games of the 30th Olympiad would be in London. Planning documents pledged that the great legacy of the Games would be to level a nation of sport lovers away from their couches. The population would be fitter, healthier and produce more winners. It has not happened. The number of adults doing weekly sport did rise, by nearly 2 million in the run-up to 2012-but the general population was growing faster. Worse, the numbers are now falling at an accelerating rate. The opposition claims primary school pupils doing at least two hours of sport a week have nearly halved. Obesity has risen among adults and children. Official retrospections continue as to why London 2012 failed to "inspire a generation." The success of Parkrun offers answers.
Parkun is not a race but a time trial: Your only competitor is the clock. The ethos welcomes anybody. There is as much joy over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped over the line as there is about top talent shining. The Olympic bidders, by contrast, wanted to get more people doing sports and to produce more elite athletes. The dual aim was mixed up: The stress on success over taking part was intimidating for newcomers.
Indeed, there is something a little absurd in the state getting involved in the planning of such a fundamentally "grassroots", concept as community sports associations. If there is a role for government, it should really be getting involved in providing common goods-making sure there is space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the provision of all these activities in

 
schools. But successive governments have presided over selling green spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in education. Instead of wordy, worthy strategies, future governments need to do more to provide the conditions for sport to thrive. Or at least not make them worse.
21. According to Paragraph1, Parkrun has_____. A.gained great popularity
B.created many jobs
C.strengthened community ties
D.become an official festival
22. The author believes that London's Olympic "legacy" has failed to_____. A.boost population growth
B.promote sport participation
C.improve the city's image
D.increase sport hours in schools
23. Parkrun is different from Olympic games in that it_____. A.aims at discovering talents
B.focuses on mass competition
C.does not emphasize elitism
D.does not attract first-timers
24. With regard to mass sport, the author holds that governments should_____. A.organize "grassroots" sports events
B.supervise local sports associations
C.increase funds for sports clubs
D.invest in public sports facilities
25. The author's attitude to what UK governments have done for sports is_____. A.tolerant
B.critical
C.uncertain
D.sympathetic

With so much focus on children’s use of screens, it's easy for parents to forget about their own screen use. “Tech is designed to really suck on you in,” says Jenny Radesky in her study of digital play, "and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement. It makes it hard to disengage, and leads to a lot of bleed-over into the family routine.”
Radesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at mealtimes by giving mother-child pairs a food-testing exercise. She found that mothers who sued devices
 
 
during the exercise started 20 percent fewer verbal and 39 percent fewer nonverbal interactions with their children. During a separate observation, she saw that phones became a source of tension in the family. Parents would be looking at their emails while the children would be making excited bids for their attention.
Infants are wired to look at parents’ faces to try to understand their world, and if those faces are blank and unresponsive—as they often are when absorbed in a device-it can be extremely disconcerting foe the children. Radesky cites the “still face experiment” devised by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick in the 1970s. In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback; The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother’s attention. "Parents don't have to be exquisitely parents at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child’s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need," says Radesky.
On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kids' use of screens are born out of an “oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always be interacting” with their children: “It’s based on a somewhat fantasized, very white, very upper-middle-class ideology that says if you’re failing to expose your child to 30,000 words you are neglecting them.” Tronick believes that just because a child isn’t learning from the screen doesn’t mean there’s no value to it-particularly if it gives parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from their child. Parents, he says, can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some work out of the way. This can make them feel happier, which lets then be more available to their child the rest of the time.
26. According to Jenny Radesky, digital products are designed to ______. A.simplify routine matters
B.absorb user attention
C.better interpersonal relations
D.increase work efficiency
27. Radesky’s food-testing exercise shows that mothers’ use of devices ______.
A.takes away babies’ appetite B.distracts children’s attention
C.slows down babies’ verbal development D.reduces mother-child communication
28. Radesky’s cites the “still face experiment” to show that _______. A.it is easy for children to get used to blank expressions
B.verbal expressions are unnecessary for emotional exchange C.children are insensitive to changes in their parents’ mood D.parents need to respond to children's emotional needs
29. The oppressive ideology mentioned by Tronick requires parents to_______.

Today, widespread social pressure to immediately go to college in conjunction with increasingly high expectations in a fast-moving world often causes students to completely overlook the possibility of taking a gap year. After all, if everyone you know is going to college in the fall, it seems silly to stay back a year, doesn't it? And after going to school for 12 years, it doesn't feel natural to spend a year doing something that isn’t academic.
But while this may be true, it’s not a good enough reason to condemn gap years. There's always a constant fear of falling behind everyone else on the socially perpetuated “race to the finish line,” whether that be toward graduate school, medical school or lucrative career. But despite common misconceptions, a gap year does not hinder the success of academic pursuits-in fact, it probably enhances it.
Studies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are generally better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not. Rather than pulling students back, a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence, new responsibilities and environmental changes-all things that first-year students often struggle with the most. Gap year experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and being thrown into a brand new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities rather than acclimation blunders.
If you're not convinced of the inherent value in taking a year off to explore interests, then consider its financial impact on future academic choices. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 80 percent of college students end up changing their majors at least once. This isn’t surprising, considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students with a poor understanding of
 
 
themselves listing one major on their college applications, but switching to another after taking college classes. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but depending on the school, it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game. At Boston College, for example, you would have to complete an extra year were you to switch to the nursing school from another department. Taking a gap year to figure things out initially can help prevent stress and save money later on.
31. One of the reasons for high-school graduates not taking a gap year is that_____.
A.they think it academically misleading B.they have a lot of fun to expect in college C.it feels strange to do differently from others D.it seems worthless to take off-campus courses
32. Studies from the US and Australia imply that taking a gap year helps_____.
A.keep students from being unrealistic B.lower risks in choosing careers C.ease freshmen’s financial burdens D.relieve freshmen of pressures
33. The word “acclimation”(Line 8, Para. 3) is closest in meaning to_____.
A.adaptation
B.application
C.motivation
D.competition
34. A gap year may save money for students by helping them_____.
A.avoid academic failures B.establish long-term goals C.switch to another college D.decide on the right major
35. The most suitable title for this text would be_____.
A.In Favor of the Gap Year B.The ABCs of the Gap Year C.The Gap Year Comes Back D.The Gap Year: A Dilemma

Though often viewed as a problem for western states, the growing frequency of wildfires is a national concern because of its impact on federal tax dollars, says Professor Max Moritz, a specialist in fire ecology and management.
 
 
In 2015, the US Forest Service for the first time spent more than half of its $5.5 billion annual budget fighting fires-nearly double the percentage it spent on such efforts 20 years ago. In effect, fewer federal funds today are going towards the agency's other work-such as forest conservation, watershed and cultural resources management, and infrastructure upkeep-that affect the lives of all Americans. Another nationwide concern is whether public funds from other agencies are going into construction in fire-prone districts. As Moritz puts it, how often are federal dollars building homes that are likely to be lost to a wildfire?
“It’s already a huge problem from a public expenditure perspective for the whole country,” he says. We need to take a magnifying glass to that. Like, “Wait a minute, is this OK?”“Do we want instead to redirect those funds to concentrate on lower-hazard parts of the landscape?”
Such a view would require a corresponding shift in the way US society today views fire, researchers say.
For one thing, conversations about wildfires need to be more inclusive. Over the past decade, the focus has been on climate change-how the warming of the Earth from greenhouse gases is leading to conditions that worsen fires.
While climate is a key element, Moritz says, it shouldn’t come at the expense of the rest of the equation.
“The human systems and the landscapes we live on are linked, and the interactions go both ways," he says. Failing to recognize that, he notes, leads to "an overly simplified view of what the solutions might be. Our perception of the problem and of what the solution is becomes very limited.”
At the same time, people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled and unleashed only out of necessity, says Professor Balch at the University of Colorado. But acknowledging fire's inevitable presence in human life is an attitude crucial to developing the laws, policies, and practices that make it as safe as possible, she says.
“We’ve disconnected ourselves from living with fire,” Balch says. “It is really important to understand and try and tease out what is the human connection with fire today.”
36. More frequent wildfires have become a national concern because in 2015 they_____.
A.exhausted unprecedented management efforts B.consumed a record-high percentage of budget C.severely damaged the ecology of western states D.caused a huge rise of infrastructure expenditure
37. Moritz calls for the use of "a magnifying glass" to _____.
A.raise more funds for fire-prone areas B.avoid the redirection of federal money C.find wildfire-free parts of the landscape
 
 
D.guarantee safer spending of public funds
38. While admitting that climate is a key element, Moritz notes that _____.
A.public debates have not settled yet B.fire-fighting conditions are improving C.other factors should not be overlooked D.a shift in the view of fire has taken place
39. The overly simplified view Moritz mentions is a result of failing to _____.
A.discover the fundamental makeup of nature B.explore the mechanism of the human systems C.maximize the role of landscape in human life D.understand the interrelations of man and nature
40. Professor Balch points out that fire is something man should _____.
A.do away with B.come to terms with C.pay a price for D.keep away from

It’s true that high-school coding classes aren’t essential for learning computer science in college. Students without experience can catch up after a few introductory courses, said Tom Cortina, the assistant dean at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science.
However, Cortina said, early exposure is beneficial. When younger kids learn computer science, they learn that it’s not just a confusing, endless string of letters and numbers — but a tool to build apps, or create artwork, or test hypotheses. It’s not as hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students. Breaking down problems into bite-sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal. Giving more children this training could increase the number of people interested in the field and help fill the jobs gap, Cortina said.
Students also benefit from learning something about coding before they get to college, where introductory computer-science classes are packed to the brim, which can drive the less-experienced or-determined students away.
The Flatiron School, where people pay to learn programming, started as one of the many coding bootcamps that’s become popular for adults looking for a career change. The high-schoolers get the same curriculum, but “we try to gear lessons toward things they’re interested in,” said Victoria Friedman, an instructor. For instance, one of the apps the students are developing suggests movies based on your mood.
The students in the Flatiron class probably won’t drop out of high school and build the next Facebook. Programming languages have a quick turnover, so the “Ruby on Rails” language they learned may not even be relevant by the time they enter the job market. But the skills they learn — how to think logically through a problem and
organize the results — apply to any coding language, said Deborah Seehorn, an education consultant for the state of North Carolina.
Indeed, the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all. But creating a future army of coders is not the sole purpose of the classes. These kids are going to be surrounded by computers — in their pockets, in their offices, in their homes — for the rest of their lives. The younger they learn how computers think, how to coax the machine into producing what they want — the earlier they learn that they have the power to do that — the better.
21. Cortina holds that early exposure to computer science makes it easier to____. A. complete future job training

  
B. remodel the way of thinking
C. formulate logical hypotheses
D. perfect artwork production
22. In delivering lessons for high-schoolers, Flatiron has considered their____. A. experience
B. academic backgrounds
C. career prospects
D. interest
23. Deborah Seehorn believes that the skills learned at Flatiron will____. A. help students learn other computer languages
B. have to be upgraded when new technologies come
C. need improving when students look for jobs
D. enable students to make big quick money
24. According to the last paragraph, Flatiron students are expected to____. A. compete with a future army of programmers
B. stay longer in the information technology industry
C. become better prepared for the digitalized world
D. bring forth innovative computer technologies
25. The word “coax” (Line4, Para.6) is closest in meaning to____. A. challenge

Biologists estimate that as many as 2 million lesser prairie chickens---a kind of bird living on stretching grasslands—once lent red to the often gray landscape of the midwestern and southwestern United States. But just some 22,000 birds remain today, occupying about 16% of the species’ historic range.
The crash was a major reason the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)decided to formally list the bird as threatened. “The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation,” said USFWS Director Daniel Ashe. Some environmentalists, however, were disappointed. They had pushed the agency to designate the bird as “endangered,” a status that gives federal officials greater regulatory power to crack down on threats. But Ashe and others argued that the “threatened” tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new, potentially less confrontational conservations approaches. In particular, they called for forging closer collaborations with western state governments, which are often uneasy with federal action and with the private landowners who control an estimated 95% of the prairie chicken’s habitat.
Under the plan, for example, the agency said it would not prosecute landowner or businesses that unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird, as long as they had signed a range—wide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat. Negotiated by USFWS and the states, the plan requires individuals and businesses that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new acres of suitable habitat. The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat, USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring
 
  
prairie chicken populations to an annual average of 67,000 birds over the next 10 years. And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition of state agencies, the job of monitoring progress. Overall, the idea is to let “states” remain in the driver’ s seat for managing the species，” Ashe said.
Not everyone buys the win-win rhetoric Some Congress members are trying to block the plan, and at least a dozen industry groups, four states, and three environmental groups are challenging it in federal court Not surprisingly, doesn’t go far enough “The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird to the same industries that are pushing it to extinction,” says biologist Jay Lininger.
26. The major reason for listing the lesser prairie as threatened is____ [A]its drastically decreased population
[B]the underestimate of the grassland acreage
[C]a desperate appeal from some biologists
[D]the insistence of private landowners

[A]agree to pay a sum for compensation
[B]volunteer to set up an equally big habitat
[C]offer to support the WAFWA monitoring job

That everyone’s too busy these days is a cliché. But one specific complaint is made especially mournfully: There’s never any time to read.
What makes the problem thornier is that the usual time-management techniques don’t seem sufficient. The web’s full of articles offering tips on making time to read: “Give up TV” or “Carry a book with you at all times” But in my experience, using such methods to free up the odd 30 minutes doesn’t work. Sit down to read and the flywheel of work-related thoughts keeps spinning-or else you’re so exhausted that a challenging book’s the last thing you need. The
 
  
modern mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes, “is overwhelmingly inclined toward communication...It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually inclined to interruption”. Deep reading requires not just time, but a special kind of time which can’t be obtained merely by becoming more efficient.
In fact, “becoming more efficient” is part of the problem. Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised means you approach it instrumentally, judging any given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances progress toward some goal immersive reading, by contrast, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency, goallessness, even time-wasting. Try to slot it as a to-do list item and you’ll manage only goal-focused reading-useful, sometimes, but not the most fulfilling kind. “The future comes at us like empty bottles along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt,” writes Gary Eberle in his book Sacred Time, and “we feel a pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, hours, minutes)as they pass, for if they get by without being filled, we will have wasted them”. No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself in a book.
So what does work? Perhaps surprisingly, scheduling regular times for reading. You’d think this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, but in fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us “step outside time’s flow” into “soul time”. You could limit distractions by reading only physical books, or on single-purpose e-readers.“Carry a book with you at all times”can actually work, too-providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business, before dropping back down. On a really good day, it no longer feels as if you’re “making time to read,” but just reading, and making time for everything else.
31. The usual time-management techniques don’t work because [A] what they can offer does not ease the modern mind
[B] what challenging books demand is repetitive reading
[C] what people often forget is carrying a book with them
[D] what deep reading requires cannot be guaranteed
32. The “empty bottles” metaphor illustrates that people feel a pressure to [A] update their to-do lists
[B] make passing time fulfilling
[C] carry their plans through
[D] pursue carefree reading
33. Eberle would agree that scheduling regular times for reading helps
[A] encourage the efficiency mind-set
[B] develop online reading habits
[C] promote ritualistic reading
[D] achieve immersive reading
34. “Carry a book with you at all times” can work if
[A] reading becomes your primary business of the day
[B] all the daily business has been promptly dealt with
[C] you are able to drop back to business after reading
[D] time can be evenly split for reading and business
35. The best title for this text could be
[A] How to Enjoy Easy Reading
[B] How to Find Time to Read
 
  
[C] How to Set Reading Goals [D] How to Read Extensively

Against a backdrop of drastic changes in economy and population structure, younger
Americans are drawing a new 21st-century road map to success, a latest poll has found.
Across generational lines, Americans continue to prize many of the same traditional milestones of a successful life, including getting married, having children, owning a home, and retiring in their sixties. But while young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the finish line of
a fulfilling life, they offer strikingly different paths for reaching it.
Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely than older adults to
prioritize personal fulfillment in their work, to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs, to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of life, to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting married or having children, and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working outside the home, the survey found.
From career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of the searing Great Recession, those just starting out in life are defining priorities and expectations that will increasingly spread through virtually all aspects of American life, from consumer preferences to housing patterns to politics.
Young and old converge on one key point: Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe it is harder for young people today to get started in life than it was for earlier generations. While younger people are somewhat more optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out today, big majorities in both groups believe those “just getting started in life” face a tougher a good-paying job, starting a family, managing debt, and finding affordable housing.
Pete Schneider considers the climb tougher today. Schneider, a 27-yaear-old auto technician from the Chicago suburbs says he struggled to find a job after graduating from college. Even now that he is working steadily, he said.” I can’t afford to pay ma monthly mortgage payments on my own, so I have to rent rooms out to people to mark that happen.” Looking back, he is struck that his parents could provide a comfortable life for their children even though neither had completed college when he was young. “I still grew up in an upper middle-class home with parents who didn’t have college degrees,” Schneider said. “I don’t think people are capable of that anymore.”
36. One cross-generation mark of a successful life is_____. [A] trying out different lifestyles
[B] having a family with children
[C] working beyond retirement age
[D] setting up a profitable business
37. It can be learned from Paragraph 3 that young people tend to ____. [A] favor a slower life pace
[B] hold an occupation longer
[C] attach importance to pre-marital finance
[D] give priority to childcare outside the home
38. The priorities and expectations defined by the young will ____.
 
 
[A] become increasingly clear
[B] focus on materialistic issues
[C] depend largely on political preferences
[D] reach almost all aspects of American life
39. Both young and old agree that ____.
[A] good-paying jobs are less available
[B] the old made more life achievements
[C] housing loans today are easy to obtain
[D] getting established is harder for the young
40. Which of the following is true about Schneider?
[A] He found a dream job after graduating from college.
[B] His parents believe working steadily is a must for success. [C] His parents’ good life has little to do with a college degree. [D] He thinks his job as a technician quite challenging.

In our contemporary culture, the prospect of communicating with -- or even looking at -- a stranger is virtually unbearable. Everyone around us seems to agree by the way they fiddle with their phones, even without a 1 underground.
It's a sad reality -- our desire to avoid interacting with other human beings -- because there's 2 to be gained from talking to the stranger standing by you. But you wouldn't know it, 3 into your phone. This universal armor sends the 4 : "Please don't approach me."
What is it that makes us feel we need to hide 5 our screens?
One answer is fear, according to Jon Wortmann, executive mental coach. We fear rejection, or that our innocent social advances will be 6 as "creepy,". We fear we'll be 7 . We fear we'll be disruptive. Strangers are inherently 8 to us, so we are more likely to feel 9 when communicating with them compared with our friends and acquaintances. To avoid this anxiety, we 10 to our phones. "Phones become our security blanket," Wortmann says. "They are our happy glasses that protect us from what we perceive is going to be more 11 .”
But once we rip off the bandaid, tuck our smartphones in our pockets and look up, it doesn't 12 so bad. In one 2011 experiment, behavioral scientists Nicholas Epley and Juliana Schroeder asked commuters to do the unthinkable: Start a 13 . They had Chicago train commuters talk to their fellow 14 . "When Dr. Epley and Ms. Schroeder asked other people in the same train station to 15 how they would feel after talking to a stranger, the commuters thought their 16 would be more pleasant if they sat on their own," the New York Times summarizes. Though the participants didn't expect a positive experience, after they 17 with the experiment, "not a single person reported having been snubbed."
18 , these commutes were reportedly more enjoyable compared with those sans communication, which makes absolute sense, 19 human beings thrive off of social connections. It's that 20 : Talking to strangers can make you feel connected.

A new study suggests that contrary to most surveys, people are actually more stressed at home than at work. Researchers measured people’s cortisol, which is a stress marker, while they were at work and while they were at home and found it higher at what is supposed to be a place of refuge.
 
  
“Further contradicting conventional wisdom, we found that women as well as men have lower levels of stress at work than at home, ” writes one of the researchers, Sarah Damske. In fact women even say they feel better at work, she notes.“ It is men, not women, who report being happier at home than at work. ”Another surprise is that findings hold true for both those with children and without, but more so for nonparents. This is why people who work outside the home have better health.
What the study doesn’t measure is whether people are still doing work when they’re at home, whether it is household work or work brought home from the office. For many men, the end of the workday is a time to kick back. For women who stay home, they never get to leave the office. And for women who work outside the home, they often are playing catch-up-with-household tasks. With the blurring of roles, and the fact that the home front lags well behind the workplace a making adjustments for working women, it’s not surprising that women are more stressed at home.
But it’s not just a gender thing. At work, people pretty much know what they’re supposed to be doing: working, marking money, doing the tasks they have to do in order to draw an income. The bargain is very pure: Employee puts in hours of physical or mental labor and employee draws out life-sustaining moola.
On the home front, however, people have no such clarity. Rare is the household in which the division of labor is so clinically and methodically laid out. There are a lot of tasks to be done, there are inadequate rewards for most of them. Your home colleagues-your family-have no clear rewards for their labor; they need to be talked into it, or if they’re teenagers, threatened with complete removal of all electronic devices. Plus, they’re your family. You cannot fire your family. You never really get to go home from home.
So it’s not surprising that people are more stressed at home. Not only are the tasks apparently infinite, the co-workers are much harder to motivate.
21.According to Paragraph 1,most previous surveys found that home_____ [A] offered greater relaxation than the workplace
[B] was an ideal place for stress measurement
[C] generated more stress than the workplace
[D] was an unrealistic place for relaxation
22. According to Damaske, who are likely to be the happiest at home? [A] Childless wives
[B] Working mothers
[C] Childless husbands
[D] Working fathers
 
  
23.The blurring of working women's roles refers to the fact that_____ [A] it is difficult for them to leave their office
[B] their home is also a place for kicking back
[C] there is often much housework left behind
[D] they are both bread winners and housewives
24.The word“moola”(Line4,Para4)most probably means_____ [A] skills
[B] energy
[C] earnings
[D] nutrition
25.The home front differs from the workplace in that_____ [A] division of labor at home is seldom clear-cut
[B] home is hardly a cozier working environment
[C] household tasks are generally more motivating
[D] family labor is often adequately rewarded

For years, studies have found that first-generation college students- those who do not have a parent with a college degree- lag other students on a range of education achievement factors. Their grades are lower and their dropout rates are higher. But since such students are most likely to advance economically if they succeed in higher education, colleges and universities have pushed for decades to recruit more of them. This has created “a paradox” in that recruiting first- generation students, but then watching many of them fail, means that higher education has “continued to reproduce and widen, rather than close” ab achievement gap based on social class, according to the depressing beginning of a paper forthcoming in the journal Psychological Science.
But the article is actually quite optimistic, as it outlines a potential solution to this problem, suggesting that an approach (which involves a one-hour, next-to-no-cost program) can close 63 percent of the achievement gap (measured by such factors as grades) between first-generation and other students.
The authors of the paper are from different universities, and their findings are based on a study involving 147 students ( who completed the project) at an unnamed private university. First generation was defined as not having a parent with a four-year college degree. Most of the first-generation students(59.1 percent) were recipients of Pell
 
  
Grants, a federal grant for undergraduates with financial need, while this was true only for 8.6 percent of the students wit at least one parent with a four-year degree.
Their thesis- that a relatively modest intervention could have a big impact- was based on the view that first-generation students may be most lacking not in potential but in practical knowledge about how to deal with the issues that face most college students. They cite past research by several authors to show that this is the gap that must be narrowed to close the achievement gap.
Many first- generation students “struggle to navigate the middle-class culture of higher education, learn the ‘rules of the game,’ and take advantage of college resources,” they write. And this becomes more of a problem when collages don’t talk about the class advantage and disadvantages of different groups of students. Because US colleges and universities seldom acknowledge how social class can affect students ’educational experience, many first-generation students lack sight about why they are struggling and do not understand how students’ like them can improve.
26. Recruiting more first- generation students has_______ [A] reduced their dropout rates
[B] narrowed the achievement gap
[C] missed its original purpose
[D] depressed college students
27. The author of the research article are optimistic because_______
[A] the problem is solvable
[B] their approach is costless
[C] the recruiting rate has increased
[D] their finding appeal to students
28. The study suggests that most first- generation students______
[A] study at private universities
[B] are from single-parent families
[C] are in need of financial support
[D] have failed their collage
29. The author of the paper believe that first-generation students_______
 
  
[A] are actually indifferent to the achievement gap
[B] can have a potential influence on other students
[C] may lack opportunities to apply for research projects
[D] are inexperienced in handling their issues at college
30. We may infer from the last paragraph that_______
[A] universities often reject the culture of the middle-class [B] students are usually to blame for their lack of resources [C] social class greatly helps enrich educational experiences [D]colleges are partly responsible for the problem in question

Even in traditional offices, “the lingua franca of corporate America has gotten much more emotional and much more right-brained than it was 20 years ago,” said Harvard Business School professor Nancy Koehn. She started spinning off examples. “If you and I parachuted back to Fortune 500 companies in 1990, we would see much less frequent use of terms like journey, mission, passion. There were goals, there were strategies, there were objectives, but we didn’t talk about energy; we didn’t talk about passion.”
Koehn pointed out that this new era of corporate vocabulary is very “team”-oriented—and not by coincidence. “Let’s not forget sports—in male-dominated corporate America, it’s still a big deal. It’s not explicitly conscious; it’s the idea that I’m a coach, and you’re my team, and we’re in this together. There are lots and lots of CEOs in very different companies, but most think of themselves as coaches and this is their team and they want to win.”
These terms are also intended to infuse work with meaning—and, as Khurana points out, increase allegiance to the firm. “You have the importation of terminology that historically used to be associated with non-profit organizations and religious organizations: Terms like vision, values, passion, and purpose,” said Khurana.
This new focus on personal fulfillment can help keep employees motivated amid increasingly loud debates over work-life balance. The “mommy wars” of the 1990s are still going on today, prompting arguments about why women still can’t have it all and books like Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In, whose title has become a buzzword in its own right. Terms like unplug, offline, life-hack, bandwidth, and capacity are all about setting boundaries between the office and the home. But if your work is your “passion,” you’ll be more likely to devote yourself to it, even if that means going home for dinner and then working long after the kids are in bed.
But this seems to be the irony of office speak: Everyone makes fun of it, but managers love it, companies depend on it, and regular people willingly absorb it. As Nunberg said, “You can get people to think it’s nonsense at
 
  
the same time that you buy into it.” In a workplace that’s fundamentally indifferent to your life and its meaning, office speak can help you figure out how you relate to your work—and how your work defines who you are.

[B] more objective
[C] less energetic
[D] less strategic
32. “Team”-oriented corporate vocabulary is closely related to_______ [A] historical incidents

Many people talked of the 288,000 new jobs the Labor Department reported for June, along with the drop in the unemployment rate to 6.1 percent, as good news. And they were right. For now it appears the economy is creating jobs at a decent pace. We still have a long way to go to get back to full employment, but at least we are now finally moving forward at a faster pace.
However, there is another important part of the jobs picture that was largely overlooked. There was a big jump in the number of people who repot voluntarily working part-time. This figure is now 830,000(4.4 percent)above its year ago level.
Before explaining the connection to the Obamacare, it is worth making an important distinction. Many people who work part-time jobs actually want full-time jobs. They take part-time work because this is all they can get. An increase in involuntary part-time work is evidence of weakness in the labor market and it means that many people will be having a very hard time making ends meet.
There was an increase in involuntary part-time in June, but the general direction has been down. Involuntary part-time employment is still far higher than before the recession, but it is down by 640,000(7.9percent)from is year ago level.
We know the difference between voluntary and involuntary part-time employment because people tell us. The survey used by the Labor Department asks people is they worked less than 35 hours in the reference week. If the answer is “yes”, they are classified as worked less than 35hours in that week because they wanted to work less than full time or because they had no choice .They are only classified as voluntary part-time workers if they tell the survey taker they chose to work less than 35 hours a week.
The issue of voluntary part-time relates to Obamacare because one of the main purposes was to allow people to get insurance outside of employment. For many people , especially those with serious health conditions or family members with serious health conditions ,before Obamacare the only way to get insurance was through a job that provided health insurance.
However, Obamacare has allowed more than 12 million people to either get insurance through Medicaid or the exchanges. These are people who may previously have felt the need to get a full-time job that provided insurance in order to cover themselves and their families. With Obamacare there is no longer a link between employment and insurance.
36. Which part of the jobs picture are neglected? [A] The prospect of a thriving job market.
[B] The increase of voluntary part-time market.
 
 
[C] The possibility of full employment.
[D] The acceleration of job creation.
37. Many people work part-time because they_____.
[A] prefer part-time jobs to full-time jobs.
[B] feel that is enough to make ends meet.
[C] cannot get their hands on full-time jobs.
[D] haven’t seen the weakness of the market.
38. Involuntary part-time employment is the US_____.
[A] is harder to acquire than one year ago.
[B] shows a general tendency of decline.
[C] satisfies the real need of the jobless.
[D] is lower than before the recession.
39. It can be learned that with Obamacare,_____.
[A] it is no longer easy for part-timers to get insurance
[B] employment is no longer a precondition to get insurance [C] it is still challenging to get insurance for family members [D] full-time employment is still essential for insurance
40. The text mainly discusses_______.
[A] employment in the US
[B] part-timer classification
[C] insurance though Medicaid
[D] Obamacare’s trouble

Thinner isn’t always better. A number of studies have __1___ that normal-weight people are in fact at higher risk of some diseases compared to those who are overweight. And there are health conditions for which being overweight is actually ___2___. For example, heavier women are less likely to develop calcium deficiency than thin women. ___3___ among the elderly, being somewhat overweight is often an ___4___ of good health.
Of even greater ___5___ is the fact that obesity turns out to be very difficult to define. It is often defined ___6___ body mass index, or BMI. BMI ___7__ body mass divided by the square of height. An adult with a BMI of 18 to 25 is often considered to be normal weight. Between 25 and 30 is overweight. And over 30 is considered obese. Obesity, ___8___,can be divided into moderately obese, severely obese, and very severely obese.
While such numerical standards seem 9 , they are not. Obesity is probably less a matter of weight than body fat. Some people with a high BMI are in fact extremely fit, 10 others with a low BMI may be in poor 11 .For example, many collegiate and professional football players 12 as obese, though their percentage body fat is low. Conversely, someone with a small frame may have high body fat but a 13 BMI.
Today we have a(an) _14 _ to label obesity as a disgrace.The overweight are sometimes_15_in the media with their faces covered. Stereotypes _16_ with obesity include laziness, lack of will power,and lower prospects for success.Teachers,employers,and health professionals have been shown to harbor biases against the obese. _17_very young children tend to look down on the overweight, and teasing about body build has long been a problem in schools.

What would you do with 590m? This is now a question for Gloria Mackenzie, an 84-year-old widow who recently emerged from her small, tin-roofed house in Florida to collect the biggest

 
 undivided lottery jackpot in history. If she hopes her new-found for tune will yield lasting feelings of fulfillment, she could do worse than read Happy Money by Elizabeth Dumn and Michael Norton.
These two academics use an array of behavioral research to show that the most rewarding ways to spend money can be counterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth often involve visions of fancy cars and extravagant homes. Yet satisfaction with these material purchases wears off fairly quickly what was once exciting and new becomes old-hat; regret creeps in. It is far better to spend money on experiences, say Ms Dumn and Mr Norton, like interesting trips, unique meals or even going to the cinema. These purchases often become more valuable with time-as stories or memories-particularly if they involve feeling more connected to others.
This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most "happiness bang for your buck." It seems most people would be better off if they could shorten their commutes to work, spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching television (something the average American spends a whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier for it).Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself, and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. This is apparently the reason MacDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib - a marketing trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an object of obsession.
Readers of “HappyMoney” are clearly a privileged lot, anxious about fulfillment, not hunger.Money may not quite buy happiness, but people in wealthier countries are generally happier than those in poor ones. Yet the link between feeling good and spending money on others can be seen among rich and poor people around the world, and scarcity enhances the pleasure of most things for most people. Not everyone will agree with the authors’ policy ideas, which range from mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives for American homebuyers. But most people will come away from this book believing it was money well spent。
21.According to Dumn and Norton,which of the following is the most rewarding purchase? [A]A big house
[B]A special tour
[C]A stylish car
[D]A rich meal
22.The author’s attitude toward Americans’ watching TV is [A]critical

 [C]sympathetic
[D]ambiguous
23.Macrib is mentioned in paragraph 3 to show that [A]consumers are sometimes irrational [B]popularity usually comes after quality [C]marketing tricks are after effective
[D]rarity generally increases pleasure
24.According to the last paragraph,Happy Money [A]has left much room for readers’criticism
[B]may prove to be a worthwhile purchase
[C]has predicted a wider income gap in the us [D]may give its readers a sense of achievement 25.This text mainly discusses how to
[A]balance feeling good and spending money [B]spend large sums of money won in lotteries [C]obtain lasting satisfaction from money spent [D]become more reasonable in spending on luxuries Text 2
An article in Scientific America has pointed out that empirical research says that, actually, you think you’re more beautiful than you are. We have a deep-seated need to feel good about ourselves and we naturally employ a number of self-enhancing strategies to research into what the call the “above average effect”, or “illusory superiority”, and shown that, for example, 70% of us rate ourselves as above average in leadership, 93% in driving and 85% at getting on well with others—all obviously statistical impossibilities.

 
 We rose tint our memories and put ourselves into self-affirming situations. We become defensive when criticized, and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our own esteem, we stalk around thinking we’re hot stuff.
Psychologist and behavioral scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw a key studying into self-enhancement and attractiveness. Rather that have people simply rate their beauty compress with others, he asked them to identify an original photogragh of themselves’ from a lineup including versions that had been altered to appear more and less attractive. Visual recognition, reads the study, is “an automatic psychological process occurring rapidly and intuitively with little or no apparent conscious deliberation”. If the subjects quickly chose a falsely flattering image- which must did- they genuinely believed it was really how they looked. Epley found no significant gender difference in responses. Nor was there any evidence that, those who self-enhance the must (that is, the participants who thought the most positively doctored picture were real) were doing so to make up for profound insecurities. In fact those who thought that the images higher up the attractiveness scale were real directly corresponded with those who showed other makers for having higher self-esteem. “I don’t think the findings that we having have are any evidence of personal delusion”, says Epley. “It’s a reflection simply of people generally thinking well of themselves’. If you are depressed, you won’t be self-enhancing. Knowing the results of Epley ‘s study,it makes sense that why people heat photographs of themselves Viscerally-on one level, they don’t even recognise the person in the picture as themselves, Facebook therefore ,is a self-enhancer’s paradise,where people can share only the most flattering photos, the cream of their wit ,style ,beauty, intellect and lifestyle it’s not that people’s profiles are dishonest,says catalina toma of Wiscon—Madison university ,”but they portray an idealized version of themselves.

Up until a few decades ago, our visions of the future were largely - though by no means uniform ly - glowingly positive. Science and technology would cure all the ills of humanity, leading to lives o f fulfillment and opportunity for all.
Now utopia has grown unfashionable, as we have gained a deeper appreciation of the range of t hreats facing us, from asteroid strike to epidemic flu and to climate change. You might even be tempt ed to assume that humanity has little future to look forward to.
But such gloominess is misplaced. The fossil record shows that many species have endured for millions of years - so why shouldn't we? Take a broader look at our species' place in the universe, an d it becomes clear that we have an excellent chance of surviving for tens, if not hundreds, of thousan

 
 ds of years. Look up Homo sapiens in the "Red List" of threatened species of the International union for the Conversation of Nature (IUCN) ,and you will read: "Listed as Least Concern as the species i
s very widely distributed, adaptable, currently increasing, and there are no major threats resulting in a n overall population decline."
So what does our deep future hold? A growing number of researchers and organizations are now thinking seriously about that question. For example, the Long Now Foundation has its flagship proje
ct a medical clock that is designed to still be marking time thousands of years hence.
Perhaps willfully, it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about the more i mmediate future. The potential evolution of today's technology, and its social consequences, is dazzli ngly complicated, and it's perhaps best left to science fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we
can envisage. That's one reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the n ear future.
But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that we can say with considerable assura nce. As so often, the past holds the key to the future: we have now identified enough of the long-term patterns shaping the history of the planet, and our species, to make evidence-based forecasts about th
e situations in which our descendants will find themselves.
This long perspective makes the pessimistic view of our prospects seem more likely to be a pass ing fad. To be sure, the future is not all rosy. But we are now knowledgeable enough to reduce many of the risks that threatened the existence of earlier humans, and to improve the lot of those to come.
31. Our vision of the future used to be inspired by [A] ourdesire for lives of fulfillment
[B] ourfaith in science and technology
[C] our awareness of potential risks
[D] our belief in equal opportunity
32. The IUCN’s “Red List” suggest that human being are [A] a sustained species
[B] a threaten to the environment

 re

 [C] the world’s dominant power
[D] a misplaced race
33. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 5? [A] Arc helps limit the scope of futurological studies.
[B] Technology offers solutions to social problem.
[C] The interest in science fiction is on the rise.
[D] Our Immediate future is hard to conceive.
34. To ensure the future of mankind, it is crucial to
[A] explore our planet’s abundant resources
[B] adoptan optimistic view of the world
[C] drawon our experience from the past

[A] Uncertainty about Our Futu
When the government talks about infrastructure contributing to the economy the focus is usually on roads, railways, broadband and energy. Housing is seldom mentioned.
Why is that? To some extent the housing sector must shoulder the blame. We have not been good at communicating the real value that housing can contribute to economic growth. Then there is the scale of the typical housing project. It is hard to shove for attention among multibillion-pound infrastructure project, so it is inevitable that the attention is focused elsewhere. But perhaps the most significant reason is that the issue has always been so politically charged.

 
 Nevertheless, the affordable housing situation is desperate. Waiting lists increase all the time and we are simply not building enough new homes.
The comprehensive spending review offers an opportunity for the government to help rectify this. It needs to put historical prejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgent housing need.
There are some indications that it is preparing to do just that. The communities minister, Don Foster, has hinted that George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, may introduce more flexibility to the current cap on the amount that local authorities can borrow against their housing stock debt. Evidence shows that 60,000 extra new homes could be built over the next five years if the cap were lifted, increasing GDP by 0.6%.
Ministers should also look at creating greater certainty in the rental environment, which would have a significant impact on the ability of registered providers to fund new developments from revenues.
But it is not just down to the government. While these measures would be welcome in the short term, we must face up to the fact that the existing £4.5bn programme of grants to fund new affordable housing, set to expire in 2015,is unlikely to be extended beyond then. The Labour party has recently announced that it will retain a large part of the coalition’s spending plans if returns to power. The housing sector needs to accept that we are very unlikely to ever return to era of large-scale public grants. We need to adjust to this changing climate.
36. The author believes that the housing sector__ [A] has attracted much attention
[B] involves certain political factors
[C] shoulders too much responsibility
[D] has lost its real value in economy
37. It can be learned that affordable housing has__ [A] increased its home supply
[B] offered spending opportunities
[C] suffered government biases
[D] disappointed the government

 
 38. According to Paragraph 5,George Osborne may_______. [A] allow greater government debt for housing
[B] stop local authorities from building homes
[C] prepare to reduce housing stock debt
[D] release a lifted GDP growth forecast
39.It can be inferred that a stable rental environment would_______. [A]lower the costs of registered providers
[B]lessen the impact of government interference
[C]contribute to funding new developments
[D]relieve the ministers of responsibilities
40.The author believes that after 2015,the government may______. [A]implement more policies to support housing
[B]review the need for large-scale public grants
[C]renew the affordable housing grants programme
[D]stop generous funding to the housing sector

Given the advantages of electronic money, you might think that we would move quickly to the cashless society in which all payments are made electronically. 1 a true cashless society is probably not around the corner. Indeed, predictions have been 2 for two decades but have not yet come to fruition. For example, Business Week predicted in 1975 that electronic means of payment would soon "revolutionize the very 3 of money itself," only to 4 itself several years later. Why has the movement to a cashless society been so 5 in coming?
Although electronic means of payment may be more efficient than a payments system based on paper, several factors work 6 the disappearance of the paper system. First, it is very 7 to set up the computer, card reader, and telecornmunications networks necessary to make electronic money

to 19 security issues. A further concern is that the use of electronic means of payment leaves an electronic 20 that contains a large amount of personal data. There are concerns that government, employers, and marketers might be able to access these data, thereby violating our privacy.

In an essay entitled “Making It in America”, the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill only two employees today,” a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines.”
Davidson’s article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is also because of the advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign worker.
In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job，could earn an average
lifestyle ,But ,today ,average is officially over. Being average just won’t earn you what it used to. It can’t when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra-their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment.
Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. But there’s been an acceleration. As Davidson notes,” In the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs-about 6 million in total -disappeared.
There will always be changed-new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average.
In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to support employment, but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G.I.Bill for the 21st century that ensures that every American has access to poet-high school education.
21. The joke in Paragraph 1 is used to illustrate_______. [A] the impact of technological advances
[B] the alleviation of job pressure

  
[C] the shrinkage of textile mills
[D] the decline of middle-class incomes
22. According to Paragraph 3, to be a successful employee, one has to______
[A] work on cheap software
[B] ask for a moderate salary
[C] adopt an average lifestyle
[D] contribute something unique
23. The quotation in Paragraph 4 explains that ______
[A] gains of technology have been erased
[B] job opportunities are disappearing at a high speed
[C] factories are making much less money than before
[D] new jobs and services have been offered
24. According to the author, to reduce unemployment, the most important is_____
[A] to accelerate the I.T. revolution
[B] to ensure more education for people [C] to advance economic globalization [D] to pass more bills in the 21st century
25. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the text? [A] New Law Takes Effect
[B] Technology Goes Cheap
[C] Average Is Over
[D] Recession Is Bad

A century ago, the immigrants from across the Atlantic included settlers and sojourners. Along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in the United States came those who had no intention to stay, and 7millin people arrived while about 2 million departed. About a quarter of all
 
  
Italian immigrants, for example, eventually returned to Italy for good. They even had an affectionate nickname, “uccelli di passaggio,” birds of passage.
Today, we are much more rigid about immigrants. We divide newcomers into two categories: legal or illegal, good or bad. We hail them as Americans in the making, or our broken immigration system and the long political paralysis over how to fix it. We don’t need more categories, but we need to change the way we think about categories. We need to look beyond strict definitions of legal and illegal. To start, we can recognize the new birds of passage, those living and thriving in the gray areas. We might then begin to solve our immigration challenges.
Crop pickers, violinists, construction workers, entrepreneurs, engineers, home health-care aides and physicists are among today’s birds of passage. They are energetic participants in a global economy driven by the flow of work, money and ideas .They prefer to come and go as opportunity calls them , They can manage to have a job in one place and a family in another.
With or without permission, they straddle laws, jurisdictions and identities with ease. We need them to imagine the United States as a place where they can be productive for a while without committing themselves to staying forever. We need them to feel that home can be both here and there and that they can belong to two nations honorably.
Accommodating this new world of people in motion will require new attitudes on both sides of the immigration battle .Looking beyond the culture war logic of right or wrong means opening up the middle ground and understanding that managing immigration today requires multiple paths and multiple outcomes. Including some that are not easy to accomplish legally in the existing system.
26 “Birds of passage” refers to those who____. [A] immigrate across the Atlantic
[B] leave their home countries for good
[C] stay in a foreign temporarily
[D]find permanent jobs overseas
27 It is implied in paragraph 2 that the current immigration system in the US ____. [A] needs new immigrant categories
[B] has loosened control over immigrants
[C] should be adopted to meet challenges
[D] has been fixed via political means
28 According to the author, today’s birds of passage want___
 
  
[A] financial incentives.
[B] a global recognition.
[C] opportunities to get regular jobs.
[D]the freedom to stay and leave.
29 The author suggests that the birds of passage today should be treated __ [A] as faithful partners.
[B] with economic favors.
[C] with regal tolerance.
[D]as mighty rivals.
30 which is the best title of the passage?
[A] come and go: big mistake
[B] living and thriving : great risk
[C] with or without : great risk
[D]legal or illegal: big mistake

Scientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions, if we take a moment and think about how we are likely to react, we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick, hard-wired responses.
Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms; if we are judging whether someone is dangerous, our brains and bodies are hard-wired to react very quickly, within milliseconds. But we need more time to assess other factors. To accurately tell whether someone is sociable, studies show, we need at least a minute, preferably five. It takes a while to judge complex aspects of personality, like neuroticism or open-mindedness.
But snap decisions in reaction to rapid stimuli aren’t exclusive to the interpersonal realm. Psychologists at the University of Toronto found that viewing a fast-food logo for just a few milliseconds primes us to read 20 percent faster, even though reading has little to do with eating. We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses into whatever
 
  
else we’re doing, Subjects exposed to fast-food flashes also tend to think a musical piece lasts too long.
Yet we can reverse such influences. If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options when we see a happy face (one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always smiling), we can take a moment before buying. If we know female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants, we can help screeners understand their biases-or hire outside screeners.
John Gottman, the marriage expert, explains that we quickly “thin slice” information reliably only after we ground such snap reactions in “thick sliced” long-term study. When Dr. Gottman really wants to assess whether a couple will stay together, he invites them to his island retreat for a muck longer evaluation; two days, not two seconds.
Our ability to mute our hard-wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals: doge can think about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes. But historically we have spent about 12 percent of our days contemplating the longer term. Although technology might change the way we react, it hasn’t changed our nature.

Europe is not a gender-equality heaven. In particular, the corporate workplace will never be completely family—friendly until women are part of senior management decisions, and Europe’s top corporate-governance positions remain overwhelmingly male. Indeed, women hold only 14 percent of positions on Europe corporate boards.
The Europe Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women-up to 60 percent. This proposed mandate was born of frustration. Last year, Europe Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action. Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goal of 40 percent female board membership. But her appeal was considered a failure: only 24 companies took it up.
Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate Ladder fairy as they balance work and family?
“Personally, I don’t like quotas,” Reding said recently. “But i like what the quotas do.” Quotas get action: they “open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling,” according to Reding, a result seen in France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions.
I understand Reding’s reluctance-and her frustration. I don’t like quotas either; they run counter to my belief in meritocracy, government by the capable. Bur, when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic ideal, it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily ordered.
 
  
After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top position— no matter how much “soft pressure ” is put upon them. When women do break through to the summit of corporate power--as, for example, Sheryl Sandberg recently did at Facebook—they attract massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule.
If appropriate pubic policies were in place to help all women—whether CEOs or their children’s caregivers—and all families, Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society.
36. In the European corporate workplace, generally_____. [A] women take the lead
[B] men have the final say
[C] corporate governance is overwhelmed
[D] senior management is family-friendly
37. The European Union’s intended legislation is ________.
[A] a reflection of gender balance [B] a reluctant choice

 Section II Reading Comprehension
Homework has never been terribly popular with students and even many parents, but in recent years it has been particularly scorned. School districts across the country, most recently Los Angeles Unified, are revising their thinking on his educational ritual. Unfortunately, L.A. Unified has produced an inflexible policy which mandates that with the exception of some advanced courses, homework may no longer count for more than 10% of a student’s academic grade.
This rule is meant to address the difficulty that students from impoverished or chaotic homes might have in completing their homework. But the policy is unclear and contradictory. Certainly, no homework should be assigned that students cannot do without expensive equipment. But if the district is essentially giving a pass to students who do not do their homework because of complicated family lives, it is going riskily close to the implication that standards need to be lowered for poor children.
District administrators say that homework will still be a pat of schooling: teachers are allowed to assign as much of it as they want. But with homework counting for no more than 10% of their grades, students can easily skip half their homework and see vey little difference on their report cards. Some students might do well on state tests without completing their homework, but what about the students who performed well on the tests and did their homework? It is quite possible that the homework helped. Yet rather than empowering teachers to find what works best for their students, the policy imposes a flat, across-the-board rule.
At the same time, the policy addresses none of the truly thorny questions about homework. If the district finds homework to be unimportant to its students’ academic achievement, it should move to reduce or eliminate the assignments, not make them count for almost nothing. Conversely, if homework does nothing to ensure that the homework students are not assigning more than they are willing to review and correct.
The homework rules should be put on hold while the school board, which is responsible for setting educational policy, looks into the matter and conducts public hearings. It is not too late for L.A. Unified to do homework right. 21.It is implied in paragraph 1 that nowadays homework_____.
[A] is receiving more criticism
[B]is no longer an educational ritual
[C]is not required for advanced courses
[D]is gaining more preferences
22.L.A.Unified has made the rule about homework mainly because poor students_____.
[A]tend to have moderate expectations for their education
[B]have asked for a different educational standard
[C]may have problems finishing their homework
[D]have voiced their complaints about homework

 
23.According to Paragraph 3,one problem with the policy is that it may____. [A]discourage students from doing homework
[B]result in students' indifference to their report cards
[C]undermine the authority of state tests
[D]restrict teachers' power in education
24. As mentioned in Paragraph 4, a key question unanswered about homework is whether______. [A] it should be eliminated
[B]it counts much in schooling
[C]it places extra burdens on teachers
[D]it is important for grades
25.A suitable title for this text could be______.

Pretty in pink: adult women do not remember being so obsessed with the colour, yet it is pervasive in our young girls’ lives. It is not that pink intrinsically bad, but it is a tiny slice of the rainbow and, though it may celebrate girlhood in one way, it also repeatedly and firmly fused girls’ identity to appearance. Then it presents that connection, even among two-year-olds, between girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence. Looking around, despaired at the singular lack of imagination about girls’ lives and interests.
Girls' attraction to pink may seem unavoidable, somehow encoded in their DNA, but according to Jo Paoletti, an associate professor of American Studies, it's not. Children were not colour-coded at all until the early 20th century: in the era before domestic washing machines all babies wore white as a practical matter, since the only way of getting clothes clean was to boil them. What's more, both boys and girls wore what were thought of as gender-neutral dresses. When nursery colours were introduced, pink was actually considered the more masculine colour, a pastel version of red, which was associated with strength. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness, symbolised femininity. It was not until the mid-1980s, when amplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children's marketing strategy, that pink fully came into its own, when it began to seem innately attractive to girls, part of what defined them as female, at least for the first few critical years.
I had not realised how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception of what is natural to kids, including our core beliefs about their psychological development. Take the toddler. I assumed that phase was something experts developed after years of research into children's behaviour: wrong. Turns out, according to Daniel Cook, a historian of childhood consumerism, it was popularised as a marketing gimmick by clothing manufacturers in the 1930s.
Trade publications counseled department stores that, in order to increase sales, they should create a "third stepping stone" between infant wear and older kids' clothes. It was only after "toddler" became common shoppers' term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental stage. Splitting kids, or adults, into ever-tinier categories has proved a sure-fire way to boost profits. And one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to magnify gender differences – or invent them where they did not previously exist.
26. By saying "it is ... The rainbow"(line 3, Para 1), the author means pink _______. A should not be the sole representation of girlhood
  
 
B should not be associated with girls' innocence
C cannot explain girls' lack of imagination
D cannot influence girls' lives and interests
27. According to Paragraph 2, which of the following is true of colours? A Colors are encoded in girls' DNA
B Blue used to be regarded as the color for girls
C Pink used to be a neutral color in symbolizing genders
D White is preferred by babies
28. The author suggests that our perception of children's psychological devotement was much influenced by ________.
[A] the marketing of products for children
[B] the observation of children's nature
[C] researches into children's behavior [D] studies of childhood consumption
29. We may learn from Paragraph 4 that department stores were advised ________.
A focuses on infant wear and older kids' clothes
B attach equal importance to different genders
C classify consumers into smaller groups
D create some common shoppers' terms
30. It can be concluded that girl's attraction to pink seems to be _____. A clearly explained by their inborn tendency
B fully understood by clothing manufacturers
C mainly imposed by profit-driven businessmen
D well interpreted by psychological experts

In 2010. a federal judge shook America's biotech industry to its core. Companies had won patents for isolated DNA for decades-by 2005 some 20% of human genes were patented. But in March 2010 a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable. Executives were violently agitated. The Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO), a trade group, assured members that this was just a “preliminary step” in a longer battle.
On July 29th they were relieved, at least temporarily. A federal appeals court overturned the prior decision, ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes that help forecast a woman's risk of breast cancer. The chief executive of Myriad, a company in Utah, said the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients alike.
But as companies continue their attempts at personalised medicine, the courts will remain rather busy. The Myriad case itself is probably not over. Critics make three main arguments against gene patents: a gene is a product of nature, so it may not be patented; gene patents suppress innovation rather than reward it; and patents' monopolies restrict access to genetic tests such as Myriad's. A growing number seem to agree. Last year a federal task-force urged reform for patents related to genetic tests. In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the Myriad case, arguing that an isolated DNA molecule “is no less a product of nature... than are cotton fibres that have been
 
 
separated from cotton seeds.”
Despite the appeals court's decision, big questions remain unanswered. For example, it is unclear whether the
sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within it. The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.
AS the industry advances, however, other suits may have an even greater impact. Companies are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules - most are already patented or in the public domain .firms are now studying how genes interact, looking for correlations that might be used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug’s efficacy. Companies are eager to win patents for ‘connecting the dots’, explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer for the BIO.
Their success may be determined by a suit related to this issue, brought by the Mayo Clinic, which the Supreme Court will hear in its next term. The BIO recently held a convention which included sessions to coach lawyers on the shifting landscape for patents. Each meeting was packed.
31. It can be learned from paragraph I that the biotech companies would like______ A. their executives to be active
B. judges to rule out gene patenting
C. genes to be patentable
D. the BIO to issue a warning
32. Those who are against gene patents believe that_____ A. genetic tests are not reliable
B. only man-made products are patentable
C. patents on genes depend much on innovations
D. courts should restrict access to genetic tests
33. According to Hans Sauer, companies are eager to win patents for_____ A. establishing disease correlations
B. discovering gene interactions
C. drawing pictures of genes
D. identifying human DNA
34.By saying “each meeting was packed”(line4,para6)the author means that_____ A. the Supreme Court was authoritative
B. the BIO was a powerful organization
C. gene patenting was a great concern
D. lawyers were keen to attend conventions
35. Generally speaking, the author’s attitude toward gene patenting is_____ A. critical

The great recession may be over, but this era of high joblessness is probably beginning. Before it ends,
It will likely change the life course and character of a generation of young adults. And ultimately, it is likely to reshape our politics, our culture, and the character of our society for years.
No one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic disaster. Many said that unemployment, while extremely painful, had improved them in some ways; they had become less materialistic and more financially prudent; they were more aware of the struggles of others. In limited respects, perhaps the recession will leave society better off. At the very least, it has awoken us from our national fever dream of easy riches and bigger houses, and put a necessary end to an era of reckless personal spending.
But for the most part, these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. In The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth, the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both inside and outside the U.S. , lengthy periods of economic stagnation or decline have almost always left society more mean-spirited and less inclusive, and have usually stopped or reversed the advance of rights and freedoms. Anti-immigrant sentiment typically increases, as does conflict between races and classes.
Income inequality usually falls during a recession, but it has not shrunk in this one. Indeed, this period of economic weakness may reinforce class divides, and decrease opportunities to cross them--- especially for young people. The research of Till Von Wachter, the economist in Columbia University, suggests that not all people graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed: those with degrees from elite universities catch up fairly quickly to where they otherwise would have been if they had graduated in better times; it is the masses beneath them that are left behind.
In the internet age, it is particularly easy to see the resentment that has always been hidden within American society. More difficult, in the moment, is discerning precisely how these lean times are affecting society’s character. In many respects, the U.S. was more socially tolerant entering this recession than at any time in its history, and a variety of national polls on social conflict since then have shown mixed results. We will have to wait and see exactly how these hard times will reshape our social fabric. But they certainly it, and all the more so the longer they extend.
36.By saying “to find silver linings”(Line 1,Para.2)the author suggest that the jobless try to___. [A]seek subsidies from the government
[B]explore reasons for the unemployment
[C]make profits from the troubled economy
[D]look on the bright side of the recession
37. According to Paragraph 2,the recession has made people_____. [A]realize the national dream
[B]struggle against each other
[C]challenge their lifestyle
[D]reconsider their lifestyle
38. Benjamin Friedman believed that economic recession may_____. [A]impose a heavier burden on immigrants
[B]bring out more evils of human nature
[C]Promote the advance of rights and freedoms
[D]ease conflicts between races and classes
 
 
39. The research of Till Von Wachther suggests that in recession graduates from elite universities tend to _____. [A]lag behind the others due to decreased opportunities
[B]catch up quickly with experienced employees
[C]see their life chances as dimmed as the others’
[D]recover more quickly than the others
40. The author thinks that the influence of hard times on society is____. [A]certain

The Internet affords anonymity to its users, a blessing to privacy and freedom of speech. But that very anonymity is also behind the explosion of cyber-crime that has 1 across the Web.
Can privacy be preserved 2 bringing safety and security to a world that seems increasingly 3 ?
Last month, Howard Schmidt, the nation’s cyber-czar, offered the federal government a 4 to make the Web a safer place-a “voluntary trusted identity” system that would be the high-tech 5 of a physical key, a fingerprint and a photo ID card, all rolled 6 one. The system might use a smart identity card, or a digital credential 7 to a specific computer .and would authenticate users at a range of online services.
The idea is to 8 a federation of private online identity systems. User could 9 which system to join, and only registered users whose identities have been authenticated could navigate those systems. The approach contrasts with one that would require an Internet driver’s license 10 by the government.
Google and Microsoft are among companies that already have these “single sign-on” systems that make it possible for users to 11 just once but use many different services.
12 .the approach would create a “walled garden” n cyberspace, with safe “neighborhoods” and bright “streetlights” to establish a sense of a 13 community.
Mr. Schmidt described it as a “voluntary ecosystem” in which “individuals and organizations can complete online transactions with 14 ,trusting the identities of each other and the identities of the
infrastructure 15 which the transaction runs”.
Still, the administration’s plan has 16 privacy rights activists. Some applaud the approach; others are
concerned. It seems clear that such a scheme is an initiative push toward what would 17 be a compulsory
Internet “drive’s license” mentality.
The plan has also been greeted with 18 by some computer security experts, who worry that the “voluntary
ecosystem” envisioned by Mr. Schmidt would still leave much of the Internet 19 .They argue that all Internet
                   users should be 20 public roads.

Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs’s board as an outside director in January 2000: a year later she became president of Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting much eroticism. But by the end of 2009 Ms. Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman’s compensation committee; how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year Ms. Simmons had left the board. The position was just taking up too much time, she said.
Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm’s board. Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the chief executive’s proposals. If the sky, and the share price is falling, outside directors should be able to give advice based on having weathered their own crises.
The researchers from Ohio University used a database hat covered more than 10,000 firms and more than 64,000 different directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one proxy statement to the next. The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers concentrated on those “surprise” disappearances by directors under the age of 70. They fount that after a surprise departure, the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increased by nearly 20%. The likelihood of being named in a federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform worse. The effect tended to be larger for larger firms. Although a correlation between them leaving and subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off a sinking ship. Often they “trade up.” Leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger and more stable firms.
But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives. Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on campus.
21. According to Paragraph 1, Ms. Simmons was criticized for   .
[A]gaining excessive profits

 
 [B]failing to fulfill her duty
[C]refusing to make compromises
[D]leaving the board in tough times
22. We learn from Paragraph 2 that outside directors are supposed to be   .

[A]become more stable
[B]report increased earnings
[C]do less well in the stock market
[D]perform worse in lawsuits
24. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that outside directors
[A]may stay for the attractive offers from the firm
[B]have often had records of wrongdoings in the firm
[C]are accustomed to stress-free work in the firm
[D]will decline incentives from the firm

Whatever happened to the death of newspaper? A year ago the end seemed near. The recession threatened to remove the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the internet. Newspapers like the San Francisco Chronicle were chronicling their own doom. America’s Federal Trade commission launched a round of talks about how to save newspapers. Should they become charitable corporations? Should the state subsidize them ? It will hold another meeting soon. But the discussions now seem out of date.
In much of the world there is the sign of crisis. German and Brazilian papers have shrugged off the recession. Even American newspapers, which inhabit the most troubled come of the global industry, have not only survived but often returned to profit. Not the 20% profit margins that were routine a few years ago, but profit all the same.
It has not been much fun. Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard. The American Society of News Editors reckons that 13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since 2007. Readers are paying more for slimmer products. Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs. Yet these desperate measures have proved the right ones and, sadly for many journalists, they can be pushed further.
Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a healthier mix of revenues from readers and advertisers. American papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads. Fully 87% of their revenues came from advertising in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD). In Japan the proportion is 35%. Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers are much more stable.
The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage has been concentrated in areas where newspaper are least distinctive. Car and film reviewers have gone. So have science
.

and general business reporters. Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off. Newspapers are less complete as a result. But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business.
26. By saying “Newspapers like ... their own doom” (Lines 3-4, Para. 1), the author indicates that
newspaper   .
[A]neglected the sign of crisis
[B]failed to get state subsidies
[C]were not charitable corporations
[D]were in a desperate situation
27. Some newspapers refused delivery to distant suburbs probably because   . [A]readers threatened to pay less
[B]newspapers wanted to reduce costs
[C]journalists reported little about these areas
[D]subscribers complained about slimmer products
28. Compared with their American counterparts, Japanese newspapers are much more stable because they   . [A]have more sources of revenue
[B]have more balanced newsrooms
[C]are less dependent on advertising
[D]are less affected by readership
29. What can be inferred from the last paragraph about the current newspaper business?
[A]Distinctiveness is an essential feature of newspapers.
[B]Completeness is to blame for the failure of newspaper.
[C]Foreign bureaus play a crucial role in the newspaper business.

We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth, with soldiers returning home by the millions, going off to college on the G. I. Bill and lining up at the marriage bureaus.
But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly be more. During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and that restraint, in combination with the postwar confidence in the future, made small, efficient housing positively stylish.
Economic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living. The phrase “less is more” was actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who like other people associated with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the United States before World War II
and took up posts at American architecture schools. These designers came to exert enormous influence on the course of American architecture, but none more so that Mies.
Mies’s signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact that a lot. Elegance, he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other modern architects, he employed metal, glass and laminated wood-materials that we take for granted today buy that in the 1940s symbolized the future. Mies’s sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were small and efficient, rather than big and often empty.
  
 
The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, for example, were smaller-two-bedroom units under 1,000 square feet-than those in their older neighbors along the city’s Gold Coast. But they were popular because of their airy glass walls, the views they afforded and the elegance of the buildings’ details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of the abstract art so popular at the time.
The trend toward “less” was not entirely foreign. In the 1930s Frank Lloyd Wright started building more modest and efficient houses-usually around 1,200 square feet-than the spreading two-story ones he had designed in the 1890s and the early 20th century.
The “Case Study Houses” commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts & Architecture magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the “less is more” trend. Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing. In his Case Study House, Ralph everyday life - few American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers - but his belief that self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared.

Will the European Union make it? The question would have sounded strange not long ago. Now even the project’s greatest cheerleader’s talk of a continent facing a “Bermuda triangle” of debt, population decline and lower growth.
As well as those chronic problems, the EU faces an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16 countries that use the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone’s economies, weaker or stronger, will one day
 
 
converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency, which denies uncompetitive members the quick fix of devaluation.
Yet the debate about how to save Europe’s single currency from disintegration is stuck. It is stuck because the euro zone’s dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for greater harmonization within the euro zone, but disagree about what to harmonies.
Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrow spending and competitiveness, barked by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not obey. These might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega-projects and even the suspension of a country’s voting rights in EU ministerial councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the EU club, among whom there is a small majority for free-market liberalism and economic rigors; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small majority favour French interference.
A “southern” camp headed by French wants something different:”European economic government” within an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians intervening in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers. Finally, figures close to the France government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonization: e.g., curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or labour costs.
It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world’s largest trading block. At its best, the European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, its internal borders are far more open to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalization, and make capitalism benign.
36. The EU is faced with so many problems that .
[A] it has more or less lost faith in markets
[B] even its supporters begin to feel concerned
[C] some of its member countries plan to abandon euro
[D] it intends to deny the possibility of devaluation
37. The debate over the EU’s single currency is stuck because the dominant powers .
[A] are competing for the leading position
[B] are busy handling their own crises
[C] fail to reach an agreement on harmonization
[D] disagree on the steps towards disintegration
38. To solve the euro problem, Germany proposed that .
[A] EU funds for poor regions be increased
[B] stricter regulations be imposed
[C] only core members be involved in economic co-ordination
[D] voting rights of the EU members be guaranteed
39. The French proposal of handling the crisis implies that __ __.
[A] poor countries are more likely to get funds
[B] strict monetary policy will be applied to poor countries
[C] loans will be readily available to rich countries
[D] rich countries will basically control Eurobonds
40. Regarding the future of the EU, the author seems to feel __ __.
[A] pessimistic
[B] desperate
  
 
 [C] conceited [D] hopeful

The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of 56 works by Damien Hirst, “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever”，at Sotheby’s in London on September 15th 2008. All but two pieces sold, fetching more than £70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer
called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy.
The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare Mc Andrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm—double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and
controversy in a way matched by few other industries.
In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst’s sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable,
especially in New York, where the bail-out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the financial demise of many art-buying investors. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector—for Chinese contemporary art—they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world’s two biggest auction houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them.
The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989, a move that started the most serious contraction in the market since the Second World War. This time experts reckon that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more fluctuant. But Edward Dolman, Christie’s chief executive, says: “I’m pretty confident we’re at the bottom.”
What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, whereas in

  
the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell. Christie’s revenues in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds—death, debt and divorce—still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.
21. In the first paragraph, Damien Hirst's sale was referred to as “a last victory” because ____. A. the art market had witnessed a succession of victories
B. the auctioneer finally got the two pieces at the highest bids
C. Beautiful Inside My Head Forever won over all masterpieces
D. it was successfully made just before the world financial crisis
22.By saying “spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable”(Line 1-2,Para.3)，the author suggests that_____.
A. collectors were no longer actively involved in art-market auctions
B .people stopped every kind of spending and stayed away from galleries
C. art collection as a fashion had lost its appeal to a great extent
D .works of art in general had gone out of fashion so they were not worth buying
23. Which of the following statements is NOT true?
A .Sales of contemporary art fell dramatically from 2007 to 2008. B. The art market surpassed many other industries in momentum. C. The market generally went downward in various ways.
D. Some art dealers were awaiting better chances to come.
24. The three Ds mentioned in the last paragraph are ____
A. auction houses ' favorites B. contemporary trends
C. factors promoting artwork circulation D. styles representing impressionists
25. The most appropriate title for this text could be ___ A. Fluctuation of Art Prices
B. Up-to-date Art Auctions
C. Art Market in Decline
D. Shifted Interest in Arts
TEXT2
I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room—a women's group that had invited men to join them. Throughout the evening one man had been particularly talkative, frequently offering ideas and anecdotes, while his wife sat silently beside him on the couch. Toward the end of the evening I commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don't talk to them. This man quickly nodded in agreement. He gestured toward his wife and said, "She's the talker in our family." The room burst into laughter; the man looked puzzled and hurt. "It's true," he explained. "When I come home from work, I have nothing to say. If she didn't keep the conversation going, we'd spend the whole evening in silence."
This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations, they often talk less at home. And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage.
  
  
The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late 1970s. Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book "Divorce Talk" that most of the women she interviewed—but only a few of the men—gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent，that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year —a virtual epidemic of failed
conversation.
In my own research complaints from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible
inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his or doing far more than their share of daily life-support work like cleaning, cooking, social arrangements and errands. Instead they focused on communication: "He doesn't listen to me." "He doesn't talk to me." I found as Hacker observed years before that most wives want their husbands to be first and foremost conversational partners but few husbands share this expectation of their wives.
In short the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face, while a woman glares at the back of it, wanting to talk.
26. What is most wives' main expectation of their husbands?
A. Talking to them. B. Trusting them. C. Supporting their careers. D. Sharing housework. 27. Judging from the context, the phrase “wreaking havoc”(Line 3,Para.2)most probably means ___ .
A. generating motivation. B. exerting influence C. causing damage D. creating pressure 28. All of the following are true EXCEPT_______
A. men tend to talk more in public than women
B. nearly 50 percent of recent divorces are caused by failed conversation C. women attach much importance to communication between couples D. a female tends to be more talkative at home than her spouse
29. Which of the following can best summarize the main idea of this text? A. The moral decaying deserves more research by sociologists.
B. Marriage break-up stems from sex inequalities.
C. Husband and wife have different expectations from their marriage. D. Conversational patterns between man and wife are different.
30. In the following part immediately after this text, the author will most probably focus on ______ A. a vivid account of the new book Divorce Talk
B. a detailed description of the stereotypical cartoon
C. other possible reasons for a high divorce rate in the U.S.
D. a brief introduction to the political scientist Andrew Hacker

Over the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors — habits —
among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks, apply lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues.
“There are fundamental public health problems, like dirty hands instead of a soap habit, that remain killers
 
  
only because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits,” Dr. Curtis said. “We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.”
The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to — Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever — had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers’ lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines.
If you look hard enough, you’ll find that many of the products we use every day — chewing gums, skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, colognes, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins— are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands.
A few decades ago, many people didn’t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.
“Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,” said Carol Berning, a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter & Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and other products last year. “Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers’ lives, and it’s essential to making new products commercially viable.”
Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged, controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods. 31. According to Dr. Curtis, habits like hand washing with soap________.
A. should be further cultivated B. should be changed gradually C. are deeply rooted in history D. are basically private concerns
32. Bottled water, chewing gun and skin moisturizers are mentioned in Paragraph 5 so as to____ A. reveal their impact on people’s habits
B. show the urgent need of daily necessities
C. indicate their effect on people’s buying power
D. manifest the significant role of good habits
33. Which of the following does NOT belong to products that help create people’s habits?
A. Tide
B. Crest
C. Colgate D. Unilever
 
  
34. From the text we know that some of consumer’s habits are developed due to _____ A. perfected art of products
B. automatic behavior creation
C. commercial promotions
D. scientific experiments
35. The author’s attitude toward the influence of advertisement on people’s habits is____
A. indifferent B. negative C. positive D. biased

Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community; that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race, religion, sex, or national origin; that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter of the law. The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves, rather than electing representatives to govern for them.
But as recently as in 1986, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals. In some states, for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character. Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v. West Virginia, the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws.
The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th century. Although women first served on state juries in Utah in 1898, it was not until the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty. Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to have their names included on the jury list. This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.
In 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act, ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury. This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975 decision Taylor vs. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level. The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors.
36. From the principles of the US jury system, we learn that ______ A. both liberate and illiterate people can serve on juries
B. defendants are immune from trial by their peers
 
 
C. no age limit should be imposed for jury service
D. judgment should consider the opinion of the public
37. The practice of selecting so-called elite jurors prior to 1968 showed_____
A. the inadequacy of antidiscrimination laws
B. the prevalent discrimination against certain races
C. the conflicting ideals in jury selection procedures
D. the arrogance common among the Supreme Court justices
38. Even in the 1960s, women were seldom on the jury list in some states because_____ A. they were automatically banned by state laws
B. they fell far short of the required qualifications C. they were supposed to perform domestic duties D. they tended to evade public engagement
39. After the Jury Selection and Service Act was passed.___
A. sex discrimination in jury selection was unconstitutional and had to be abolished B. educational requirements became less rigid in the selection of federal jurors
C. jurors at the state level ought to be representative of the entire community
D. states ought to conform to the federal court in reforming the jury system
40. In discussing the US jury system, the text centers on_______ A. its nature and problems
B. its characteristics and tradition
C. its problems and their solutions
D. its tradition and development

Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. "Not choice, but habit rules the unreflecting herd," William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-changing 21st century, even the word "habit" carries a negative connotation.
So it seems antithetical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new habits, we create parallel synaptic paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks.
But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are worn into the hippocampus, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately ingrain into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.
"The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder," says Dawna Markova, author of "The Open Mind" and an executive change consultant for Professional Thinking Partners. "But we are taught instead to 'decide,' just as our president calls himself 'the Decider.' " She adds, however, that "to decide is to kill off all possibilities but one. A good innovational thinker is always exploring the many other possibilities."
All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware, she says. Researchers in the late 1960 covered that humans are born with the capacity to approach challenges in four primary ways: analytically, procedurally, relationally (or collaboratively) and innovatively. At puberty, however, the brain shuts down half of that capacity, preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed most valuable during the first decade or so of life.
The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of thought. "This breaks the major rule in the American belief system — that anyone can do anything," explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book "This Year I Will..." and Ms. Markova's business partner. "That's a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. Knowing what you're good at and doing even more of it creates excellence." This is where developing new habits comes in.
21. The view of Wordsworth habit is claimed by being ________.
A. casual B. familiar C. mechanical D. changeable
22. The researchers have discovered that the formation of habit can be ________ A. predicted B. regulated C. traced D. guided
23. "ruts"(in line one, paragraph 3) has closest meaning to ________
A. tracks B. series C. characteristics D. connections
 
 
24. Ms. Markova's comments suggest that the practice of standard testing ________? A, prevents new habits form being formed
B, no longer emphasizes commonness
C, maintains the inherent American thinking model
D, complies with the American belief system
25. Ryan most probably agree that
A. ideas are born of a relaxing mind
B. innovativeness could be taught
C. decisiveness derives from fantastic ideas D. curiosity activates creative minds

It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can boost his paternal (fatherly)
wisdom – or at least confirm that he's the kid's dad. All he needs to do is shell our $30 for paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore – and another $120 to get the results.
More than 60,000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first become available without prescriptions last years, according to Doug Fog, chief operating officer of Identigene, which makes the over-the-counter kits. More than two dozen companies sell DNA tests Directly to the public , ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to more than $2500.
Among the most popular : paternity and kinship testing , which adopted children can use to find their biological relatives and latest rage a many passionate genealogists-and supports businesses that offer to search for a family's geographic roots .
Most tests require collecting cells by webbing saliva in the mouth and sending it to the company for testing. All tests require a potential candidate with whom to compare DNA.
But some observers are skeptical, "There is a kind of false precision being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing," says Trey Duster, a New York University sociologist. He notes that each individual has many ancestors-numbering in the hundreds just a few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father's line or mitochondrial DNA, which a passed down only from mothers. This DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people also have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-grandparents.
Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good as the reference collections to which a sample is compared. Databases used by some companies don't rely on data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research projects. This means that a DNA database may differ depending on the company that processes the results. In addition, the computer programs a company uses to estimate relationships may be patented and not subject to peer review or outside evaluation.

 locate one's birth place
 promote genetic research  identify parent-child kinship  choose children for adoption
28. Skeptical observers believe that ancestry testing fails to__________.  trace distant ancestors

 fully use genetic information
 achieve the claimed accuracy
29. In the last paragraph, a problem commercial genetic testing faces is __________.  disorganized data collection

The relationship between formal education and economic growth in poor countries is widely
misunderstood by economists and politicians alike progress in both area is undoubtedly necessary for the social, political and intellectual development of these and all other societies; however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong. We are fortunate that is it, because new educational systems there and putting enough people through them to improve economic performance would require two or three generations. The findings of a research institution have
 
 
consistently shown that workers in all countries can be trained on the job to achieve radical higher productivity and, as a result, radically higher standards of living.
Ironically, the first evidence for this idea appeared in the United States. Not long ago, with the country entering a recessing and Japan at its pre-bubble peak. The U.S. workforce was derided as poorly educated and one of primary cause of the poor U.S. economic performance. Japan was, and remains, the global leader in automotive-assembly productivity. Yet the research revealed that the U.S. factories of Honda Nissan, and Toyota achieved about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts -- a result of the training that U.S. workers received on the job.
More recently, while examining housing construction, the researchers discovered that illiterate, non-English- speaking Mexican workers in Houston, Texas, consistently met best-practice labor productivity standards despite the complexity of the building industry's work.
What is the real relationship between education and economic development? We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when governments don't force it. After all, that's how education got started. When our ancestors were hunters and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they didn't have time to wonder much about anything besides finding food. Only when humanity began to get its food in a more productive way was there time for other things.
As education improved, humanity's productivity potential, they could in turn afford more education. This increasingly high level of education is probably a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the complex political systems required by advanced economic performance. Thus poor countries might not be able to escape their poverty traps without political changes that may be possible only with broader formal education. A lack of formal education, however, doesn't constrain the ability of the developing world's workforce to substantially improve productivity for the forested future. On the contrary, constraints on improving productivity explain why education isn't developing more quickly there than it is.
31. The author holds in paragraph 1 that the important of education in poor countries ___________.
  is subject groundless doubts  has fallen victim of bias
 is conventional downgraded  has been overestimated
32. It is stated in paragraph 1 that construction of a new education system  challenges economists and politicians
 takes efforts of generations
 demands priority from the government
 requires sufficient labor force
__________.
33. A major difference between the Japanese and U.S workforces is that __________.  the Japanese workforce is better disciplined

 
 the Japanese workforce is more productive  the U.S workforce has a better education  the U.S workforce is more organize
34. The author quotes the example of our ancestors to show that education emerged __________.  when people had enough time
 prior to better ways of finding food
 when people on longer went hung
 as a result of pressure on government
35. According to the last paragraph , development of education __________.  results directly from competitive environments
 does not depend on economic performance
 follows improved productivity
 cannot afford political changes

The most thoroughly studied in the history of the new world are the ministers and political
leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "So much important attached to intellectual pursuits " According to many books and articles, New England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life.
To take this approach to the New Englanders normally mean to start with the Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church-important subjects that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture adjusting to New world circumstances. The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.
The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education and influence in England. `Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to Massachusetts church in the decade after 1629,There were political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. There men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness.
We should not forget , however, that most New Englanders were less well educated. While few crafts men or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left literary compositions to be analyzed, The in thinking often had a traditional superstitions quality. A tailor named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for leaving England that is filled with signs. sexual confusion, economic frustrations , and religious hope-all name together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, told his father the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the
 
 
magical words: "come out from among them, touch no unclean thing , and I will be your God and you shall be my people." One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons explaining the Bible that he heard in puritan churched.
Meanwhile, many settles had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had not come to the New world for religion . "Our main end was to catch fish. "
36. The author notes that in the seventeenth-century New England___________.  Puritan tradition dominated political life.
 intellectual interests were encouraged.
 Politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors.
 intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment.
37. It is suggested in paragraph 2 that New Englanders__________.  experienced a comparatively peaceful early history.
 brought with them the culture of the Old World
 paid little attention to southern intellectual life
 were obsessed with religious innovations
38. The early ministers and political leaders in Massachusetts Bay__________.  were famous in the New World for their writings
 gained increasing importance in religious affairs
 abandoned high positions before coming to the New World
 created a new intellectual atmosphere in New England
39. The story of John Dane shows that less well-educated New Englanders were often __________.  influenced by superstitions
 troubled with religious beliefs
 puzzled by church sermons
 frustrated with family earnings
40. The text suggests that early settlers in New England__________.  were mostly engaged in political activities
 were motivated by an illusory prospect
 came from different backgrounds.
 left few formal records for later reference

The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than others is one of those hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But Gregory Cochran is 大1家 to say it anyway. He is
that 大2家 bird, a scientist who works independently 大3家 any institution. He helped popularize the idea that some diseases not 大4家 thought to have a bacterial cause were actually
infections, which aroused much controversy when it was first suggested.
大5家 he, however, might tremble at the 大6家 of what he is about to do. Together with
another two scientists, he is publishing a paper which not only 大7家 that one group of humanity is more intelligent than the others, but explains the process that has brought this about. The group in
大8家 are a particular people originated from central Europe. The process is natural selection.
This group generally do well in IQ test, 大9家 12-15 points above the 大10家 value of

such as a strong tradition of 大16家 education. The latter was seen as a (an) 大17家 of genetic isolation. Dr. Cochran suggests that the intelligence and diseases are intimately 大18家 . His argument is that the unusual history of these people has 大19家 them to unique evolutionary pressures that have resulted in this 大20家 state of affairs.

While still catching-up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.
Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those of the males.
Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities” for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater than men’s,” she observes, “it’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”
Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”
Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish college. “I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”
Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function.
21. Which of the following is true according to the first two paragraphs?  Women are biologically more vulnerable to stress.
 Women are still suffering much stress caused by men.
 Women are more experienced than men in coping with stress.
 Men and women show different inclinations when faced with stress.
22. Dr. Yehuda’s research suggests that women
 need extra doses of chemicals to handle stress.
 
 
 have limited capacity for tolerating stress.  are more capable of avoiding stress.
 are exposed to more stress.
23. According to Paragraph 4, the stress women confront tends to be  domestic and temporary.
 irregular and violent.
 durable and frequent.
 trivial and random.
24. The sentence “I lived from paycheck to paycheck.” (Line 6, Para. 5) shows that  Alvarez cared about nothing but making money.
 Alvarez’s salary barely covered her household expenses.
 Alvarez got paychecks from different jobs.
 Alvarez paid practically everything by check.
25. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?  Strain of Stress: No Way Out?
 Responses to Stress: Gender Difference
 Stress Analysis: What Chemicals Say
 Gender Inequality: Women Under Stress

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory would
submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the authors’ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal.
No longer. The Internet – and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting access to it – is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now, been a key element of scientific endeavor.
The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The International Association of Scientific,
 
 
Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than 1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.
This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the report’s authors. There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.
26. In the first paragraph, the author discusses
 the background information of journal editing.  the publication routine of laboratory reports.  the relations of authors with journal publishers.  the traditional process of journal publication.
27. Which of the following is true of the OECD report?  It criticizes government-funded research.
 It introduces an effective means of publication.  It upsets profit-making journal publishers.
 It benefits scientific research considerably.
28. According to the text, online publication is significant in that  it provides an easier access to scientific results.
 it brings huge profits to scientific researchers.
 it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge.  it facilitates public investment in scientific research.
29. With the open-access publishing model, the author of a paper is required to  cover the cost of its publication.
 subscribe to the journal publishing it.
 allow other online journals to use it freely.
 complete the peer-review before submission.
30. Which of the following best summarizes the text?
 
 
 The Internet is posing a threat to publishers.
 A new mode of publication is emerging.
 Authors welcome the new channel for publication.  Publication is rendered easier by online service.

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.
The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today’s people – especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many generations – apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren’t likely to get any taller. “In the general population today, at this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.
Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients – notably, protein – to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height – 5′9′′ for men, 5′4′′ for women – hasn’t really changed since 1960.
Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs. “There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.
Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by and large, “you could use today’s data and feel fairly confident.”
31. Wilt Chamberlain is cited as an example to
 illustrate the change of height of NBA players.  show the popularity of NBA players in the U.S..
 
 
 compare different generations of NBA players.  assess the achievements of famous NBA players.
32. Which of the following plays a key role in body growth according to the text?  Genetic modification.
 Natural environment.
 Living standards.
 Daily exercise.
33. On which of the following statements would the author most probably agree?  Non-Americans add to the average height of the nation.
 Human height is conditioned by the upright posture.
 Americans are the tallest on average in the world.
 Larger babies tend to become taller in adulthood.
34. We learn from the last paragraph that in the near future
 the garment industry will reconsider the uniform size.  the design of military uniforms will remain unchanged.  genetic testing will be employed in selecting sportsmen.  the existing data of human height will still be applicable.
35. The text intends to tell us that
 the change of human height follows a cyclic pattern.  human height is becoming even more predictable.  Americans have reached their genetic growth limit.  the genetic pattern of Americans has altered.

In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington, 52,
was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw – having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves.
That’s a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral compromises made by the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong – and yet most did little to fight it.
 
 
More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped to create.
For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was “like having a large bank account,” says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the “peculiar institution,” including a clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.
And the statesmen’s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes of the southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave states.
Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children – though not Hemings herself or his approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.
36. George Washington’s dental surgery is mentioned to  show the primitive medical practice in the past.  demonstrate the cruelty of slavery in his days.  stress the role of slaves in the U.S. history.
 reveal some unknown aspect of his life.
37. We may infer from the second paragraph that
 DNA technology has been widely applied to history research.
 in its early days the U.S. was confronted with delicate situations.  historians deliberately made up some stories of Jefferson’s life.
 political compromises are easily found throughout the U.S. history.
38. What do we learn about Thomas Jefferson?
 His political view changed his attitude towards slavery.  His status as a father made him free the child slaves.  His attitude towards slavery was complex.
 His affair with a slave stained his prestige.
39. Which of the following is true according to the text?
 Some Founding Fathers benefit politically from slavery.  Slaves in the old days did not have the right to vote.
 
 
 Slave owners usually had large savings accounts.  Slavery was regarded as a peculiar institution.
40. Washington’s decision to free slaves originated from his  moral considerations.
 military experience.
 financial conditions.
 political stand.

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.
What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.
Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he believes strongly in “none of the above.” Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. “With the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,” Ericsson recalls. “He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers.”
This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person “encodes” the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.
Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers – whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer programming – are nearly always made, not born.
21. The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned to  stress the importance of professional training.
 spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup.
 introduce the topic of what makes expert performance.
 explain why some soccer teams play better than others.
22. The word “mania” (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means
  
 
 fun.
 craze.
 hysteria.  excitement.
23. According to Ericsson, good memory
 depends on meaningful processing of information.
 results from intuitive rather than cognitive exercises.
 is determined by genetic rather than psychological factors.
 requires immediate feedback and a high degree of concentration.
24. Ericsson and his colleagues believe that
 talent is a dominating factor for professional success.
 biographical data provide the key to excellent performance.  the role of talent tends to be overlooked.
 high achievers owe their success mostly to nurture.
25. Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the text tries to convey?  “Faith will move mountains.”
 “One reaps what one sows.”
 “Practice makes perfect.”
 “Like father, like son.”

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column
called “Ask Marilyn.” People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 – the highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It’s not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.
Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?
The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children’s version).
 
 
Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant’s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.
Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?”, Sternberg notes that traditional test best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership – that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.
26. Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?  Answering philosophical questions.
 Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.
 Telling the differences between certain concepts.
 Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.
27. What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3?
 People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence.
 More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet.
 The test contents and formats for adults and children may be different.  Scientists have defined the important elements of human intelligence.
28. People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as high as vos Savant’s because  the scores are obtained through different computational procedures.
 creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now.
 vos Savant’s case is an extreme one that will not repeat.
 the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed.
29. We can conclude from the last paragraph that
 test scores may not be reliable indicators of one’s ability.  IQ scores and SAT results are highly correlated.
 testing involves a lot of guesswork.
 traditional test are out of date.
 
 
30. What is the author’s attitude towards IQ tests?  Supportive.
 Skeptical.  Impartial.  Biased.

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure had been transformed by economic risk and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.
In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today’s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial setback – a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This “added-worker effect” could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.
During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a saving-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen – and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families’ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of having a weak elderly parent – and all the attendant need for physical and financial assistance – have jumped eightfold in just one generation.
From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.
31. Today’s double-income families are at greater financial risk in that  the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared.
 their chances of being laid off have greatly increased.
 they are more vulnerable to changes in family economics.
 
 
 they are deprived of unemployment or disability insurance.
32. As a result of President Bush’s reform, retired people may have  a higher sense of security.
 less secured payments.
 less chance to invest.
 a guaranteed future.
33. According to the author, health-savings plans will  help reduce the cost of healthcare.
 popularize among the middle class.
 compensate for the reduced pensions.
 increase the families’ investment risk.
34. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
 financial risks tend to outweigh political risks.
 the middle class may face greater political challenges.  financial problems may bring about political problems.  financial responsibility is an indicator of political status.
35. Which of the following is the best title for this text?  The Middle Class on the Alert
 The Middle Class on the Cliff
 The Middle Class in Conflict
 The Middle Class in Ruins

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst
accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens to earn them – especially in America – the sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss’s agenda in businesses of every variety.
Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year – from organizations as diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley – have left managers hurriedly peering into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.
“Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset,” says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’s business school. “The ability to guard customer data is the key
 
 
to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders.” Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’s Columbia Business School. “Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a technical one,” he says.
The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore – and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.
The current state of affairs may have been encouraged – though not justified – by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.
36. The statement “It never rains but it pours” is used to introduce  the fierce business competition.
 the feeble boss-board relations.
 the threat from news reports.
 the severity of data leakage.
37. According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems to find out  whether there is any weak point.
 what sort of data has been stolen.
 who is responsible for the leakage.
 how the potential spies can be located.
38. In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that  shareholders’ interests should be properly attended to.
 information protection should be given due attention.
 businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.
 the market value of customer data should be emphasized.
39. According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to  see the link between trust and data protection.
 perceive the sensitivity of personal data.
 realize the high cost of data restoration.
 
 
 appreciate the economic value of trust.
40. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that
 data leakage is more severe in Europe.
 FTC’s decision is essential to data security.
 California takes the lead in security legislation.  legal penalty is a major solution to data leakage.

In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the casualness and absence of deference” characteristic of popular culture. People are absorbed into “a culture of consumption” launched by the 19th-century department stores that offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a knowledgeable elite,” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.
Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation -- language, home ownership and intermarriage.
The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.
Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S.-born whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American women are married to non-Asians.
Rodriguez notes that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”
Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.
21. The word “homogenizing” (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means ________.  identifying
 associating  assimilating  monopolizing
 
 
22. According to the author, the department stores of the 19th century ________.  played a role in the spread of popular culture
 became intimate shops for common consumers
 satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite
 owed its emergence to the culture of consumption
23. The text suggests that immigrants now in the U.S. ________.  are resistant to homogenization
 exert a great influence on American culture
 are hardly a threat to the common culture
 constitute the majority of the population
24. Why are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks mentioned in Paragraph 5?  To prove their popularity around the world.
 To reveal the public’s fear of immigrants.
 To give examples of successful immigrants.
 To show the powerful influence of American culture.
25. In the author’s opinion, the absorption of immigrants into American society is ________.  rewarding
 successful  fruitless  harmful

Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry -- William Shakespeare -- but there
are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s birthplace and the other sights.
The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. They frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness. It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise-making.
The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus -- and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side -- don’t usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into
 
 
the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.
The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.
Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 percent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.
It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) -- lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.
26. From the first two paragraphs, we learn that ________.
 the townsfolk deny the RSC’s contribution to the town’s revenue  the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage
 the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms
 the townsfolk earn little from tourism
27. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________.
 the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately  the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers
 the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers
 the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater
28. By saying “Stratford cries poor traditionally” (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), the author implies that ________.
 Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects  Stratford has long been in financial difficulties  the town is not really short of money
 the townsfolk used to be poorly paid
29. According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because ________.  ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending
 the company is financially ill-managed
 
 
 the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable  the theatre attendance is on the rise
30. From the text we can conclude that the author ________.  is supportive of both sides
 favors the townsfolk’s view
 takes a detached attitude
 is sympathetic to the RSC

When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strange happened to the large animals. They suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived. The large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans.
That the seas are being overfished has been known for years. What researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then.
Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative. One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since no baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around now.
Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the data support an idea current among marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline.” The notion is that people have failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to do business.
31. The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that ________.
 
 
 large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment  small species survived as large animals disappeared
 large sea animals may face the same threat today
 slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones
32. We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm’s paper that ________.
 the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%
 there are only half as many fisheries as there were 15 years ago
 the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount
 the number of larger predators dropped faster in new fisheries than in the old
33. By saying "these figures are conservative" (Line 1, paragraph 3), Dr. Worm means that ________.
 fishing technology has improved rapidly
 the catch-sizes are actually smaller than recorded  the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss  the data collected so far are out of date
34. Dr. Myers and other researchers hold that ________.
 people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time  fisheries should keep their yields below 50% of the biomass
 the ocean biomass should be restored to its original level
 people should adjust the fishing baseline to the changing situation
35. The author seems to be mainly concerned with most fisheries’ ________.  management efficiency
 biomass level
 catch-size limits
 technological application

Many things make people think artists are weird. But the weirdest may be this: artists’ only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.
This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy. But somewhere from the 19th century onward, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring, as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s flowers of evil.
You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen
 
 
so much misery. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the world today.
After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.
People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too.
Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And since these messages have an agenda -- to lure us to open our wallets -- they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable. “Celebrate!” commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.
But what we forget -- what our economy depends on us forgetting -- is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need art to tell us, as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It’s a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.
36. By citing the examples of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends to show that ________.
 poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music  art grows out of both positive and negative feelings  poets today are less skeptical of happiness
 artists have changed their focus of interest
37. The word “bummer” (Line 5, paragraph 5) most probably means something ________.  religious
 unpleasant  entertaining  commercial
38. In the author’s opinion, advertising ________.
 emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art
 is a cause of disappointment for the general public
  
 
 replaces the church as a major source of information
 creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself
39. We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes ________.  happiness more often than not ends in sadness
 the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing
 misery should be enjoyed rather than denied
 the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms
40. Which of the following is true of the text?
 Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery.
 Art provides a balance between expectation and reality.  People feel disappointed at the realities of modern society.  Mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths.

The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive smellers compared with animals, 大1家 this is largely because, 大2家 animals, we stand upright. This
means that our noses are 大3家 to perceiving those smells which float through the air, 大4家 the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact, 大5家 , we are extremely sensitive to smells, 大6家 we do not generally realize it. Our noses are capable of 大7家 human smells even when
these are 大8家 to far below one part in one million.
Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another, 大9家 others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary to generate 大10家 smell receptors in the nose. These receptors are the cells
which sense smells and send 大11家 to the brain. However, it has been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell 大12家 can suddenly become sensitive to it when 大13家 to it
often enough.
The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the brain finds it 大14家 to keep
all smell receptors working all the time but can 大15家 new receptors if necessary. This may 大16家 explain why we are not usually sensitive to our own smells—we simply do not need to be. We are not 大17家 of the usual smell of our own house, but we 大18家 new smells when we visit someone else’s. The brain finds it best to keep smell receptors 大19家 for unfamiliar and

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human,” with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.
The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services” than males.
Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan’s and Dr. de Waal’s study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.
In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.
The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.
21. In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic by ________.  posing a contrast
 justifying an assumption
 making a comparison
 explaining a phenomenon
22. The statement “it is all too monkey” (Last line, Paragraph l) implies that ________.

  
 monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals
 resenting unfairness is also monkeys’ nature
 monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other  no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions
23. Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most probably because they are ________.
 more inclined to weigh what they get
 attentive to researchers’ instructions
 nice in both appearance and temperament  more generous than their male companions
24. Dr. Brosnan and Dr. de Waal have eventually found in their study that the monkeys ________.  prefer grapes to cucumbers
 can be taught to exchange things
 will not be co-operative if feeling cheated
 are unhappy when separated from others
25. What can we infer from the last paragraph?
 Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions.
 Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source.
 Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do.  Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the
doubters insisted that we didn’t know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.
There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth’s atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel’s report: “Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions.”
Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global
 
  
warming is incomplete, that it’s OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.
Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it’s obvious that a majority of the president’s advisers still don’t take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research -- a classic case of “paralysis by analysis.”
To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won’t take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound.
26. An argument made by supporters of smoking was that ________.
 there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death  the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant  people had the freedom to choose their own way of life
 antismoking people were usually talking nonsense

29. According to the author, what should the Administration do about global warming?  Offer aid to build cleaner power plants.
 Raise public awareness of conservation.
 Press for further scientific research.
 Take some legislative measures.
30. The author associates the issue of global warming with that of smoking because ________.
 
  
 they both suffered from the government’s negligence  a lesson from the latter is applicable to the former  the outcome of the latter aggravates the former
 both of them have turned from bad to worse

Of all the components of a good night’s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just “mental noise” -- the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind’s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is “off-line.” And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better, “It’s your dream,” says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago’s Medical Center. “If you don’t like it, change it.”
Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep -- when most vivid dreams occur -- as it is when fully awake, says Dr, Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved; the limbic system (the “emotional brain”) is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. “We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day.” says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.
The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think about the emotional significance of the day’s events -- until, it appears, we begin to dream.
And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn to, literally, do it in their sleep.
At the end of the day, there’s probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or “we wake up in a panic,” Cartwright says. Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people’s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep -- or rather dream -- on it and you’ll feel better in the morning.
31. Researchers have come to believe that dreams ________.  can be modified in their courses
 are susceptible to emotional changes
 
  
 reflect our innermost desires and fears  are a random outcome of neural repairs
32. By referring to the limbic system, the author intends to show ________.  its function in our dreams
 the mechanism of REM sleep
 the relation of dreams to emotions
 its difference from the prefrontal cortex
33. The negative feelings generated during the day tend to ________.  aggravate in our unconscious mind
 develop into happy dreams
 persist till the time we fall asleep
 show up in dreams early at night
34. Cartwright seems to suggest that ________.
 waking up in time is essential to the ridding of bad dreams  visualizing bad dreams helps bring them under control
 dreams should be left to their natural progression
 dreaming may not entirely belong to the unconscious
35. What advice might Cartwright give to those who sometimes have bad dreams?  Lead your life as usual.
 Seek professional help.
 Exercise conscious control.
 Avoid anxiety in the daytime.

Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the
English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest book, Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should, Like, Care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.
Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic speciality is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of “whom,” for example, to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.
But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing,” has spelt the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an elevated tone
 
  
when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft.
Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive -- there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.
Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms -- he is really grieving over the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china.” A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.
36. According to McWhorter, the decline of formal English ________.  is inevitable in radical education reforms
 is but all too natural in language development
 has caused the controversy over the counter-culture
 brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s
37. The word “talking” (Line 6, Paragraph 3) denotes ________.  modesty
 personality  liveliness  informality
38. To which of the following statements would McWhorter most likely agree?  Logical thinking is not necessarily related to the way we talk.
 Black English can be more expressive than standard English.
 Non-standard varieties of human language are just as entertaining.
 Of all the varieties, standard English can best convey complex ideas.
39. The description of Russians’ love of memorizing poetry shows the author’s ________.  interest in their language
 appreciation of their efforts
 admiration for their memory
  
 
 contempt for their old-fashionedness
40. According to the last paragraph, “paper plates” is to “china” as ________.  “temporary” is to “permanent”
 “radical” is to “conservative”
 “functional” is to “artistic”
 “humble” is to “noble”

Many theories concerning the causes of juvenile delinquency (crimes committed by young people) focus either on the individual or on society as the major contributing influence. Theories 1 on the individual suggest that children engage in criminal behavior 2 they were not sufficiently penalized for previous misdeeds or that they have learned criminal behavior through 3   with others. Theories focusing on the role of society suggest that children commit crimes in 4   to their failure to rise above their socioeconomic status, 5 as a rejection of middle-class values.
Most theories of juvenile delinquency have focused on children from disadvantaged families, _ 6 the fact that children from wealthy homes also commit crimes. The latter may commit crimes 7 lack of adequate parental control. All theories, however, are tentative and are 8   to criticism.

Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon stumbled across CareerBuilder, a job database on the Internet. He searched it with no success but was attracted by the site’s “personal search agent”. It’s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such as location, title, and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position is posted in the database. Redmon chose the keywords legal, intellectual property and Washington, D.C. Three weeks later, he got his first notification of an opening. “I struck gold,” says Redmon, who E-mailed his resume to the employer and won a position as in-house counsel for a company.
With thousands of career-related sites on the Internet, finding promising openings can he time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents reduce the need for repeated visits to the databases. But although a search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks. Narrowing your criteria, for example, may work against you: “Every time you answer a question you eliminate a possibility,” says one expert.
For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept—what you think you want to do—then broaden it. “None of these programs do that,” says another expert. “There’s no career counseling implicit in all of this.” Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind of tip service to keep abreast of jobs in a particular database; when you get E-mail, consider it a reminder to check the database again. “I would not rely on agents for finding everything that is added to a database that might interest me,” says the author of a job-searching guide.
Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When CareerSite’s agent sends out messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes only three potential jobs—those it considers the best matches. There may be more matches in the database; job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them—and they do. “On the day after we send our messages, we see a sharp increase in our traffic,” says Seth Peets, vice president of marketing for CareerSite.
Even those who aren’t hunting for jobs may find search agents worthwhile. Some use them to keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather information on compensation to
  
 
arm themselves when negotiating for a raise. Although happily employed, Redmon maintains his agent at CareerBuilder. “You always keep your eyes open,” he says. Working with a personal search agent means having another set of eyes looking out for you.
21. How did Redmon find his job?
 By searching openings in a job database.
 By posting a matching position in a database.  By using a special service of a database.
 By E-mailing his resume to a database.
22. Which of the following can be a disadvantage of search agents?
 Lack of counseling.  Limited number of visits.  Lower efficiency.  Fewer successful matches.
23. The expression “tip service” (Line 4, Paragraph 3) most probably means   .  advisory.  compensation.
 interaction.  reminder.
24. Why does CareerSite’s agent offer each job hunter only three job options?  To focus on better job matches.
 To attract more returning visits.
 To reserve space for more messages.
 To increase the rate of success.
25. Which of the following is true according to the text?
 Personal search agents are indispensable to job-hunters.
 Some sites keep E-mailing job seekers to trace their demands.
 Personal search agents are also helpful to those already employed.
 Some agents stop sending information to people once they are employed.

Over the past century, all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been condemned or made illegal. But one insidious form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as yet unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.
It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big advantage over Zodiac cars when customers thumb through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbott has in life over ZoëZysman. English names are fairly evenly spread between the halves of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people have surnames beginning with letters between A and K.
Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C respectively; and 26 of George Bush’s predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking, six of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chrétien and Koizumi). The world’s three top central bankers (Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami) are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese characters. As are the world's five richest men (Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and Albrecht).
 
 
Can this merely be coincidence? One theory, dreamt up in all the spare time enjoyed by the alphabetically disadvantaged, is that the rot sets in early. At the start of the first year in infant school, teachers seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their names. So short-sighted Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, and is rarely asked the improving questions posed by those insensitive teachers. At the time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications, because they get less individual attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.
The humiliation continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are literally having a ZZZ. Shortlists for job interviews, election ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and attendees: all tend to be drawn up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as they plough through them.
26. What does the author intend to illustrate with AAAA cars and Zodiac cars?  A kind of overlooked inequality.
 A type of conspicuous bias.
 A type of personal prejudice.
 A kind of brand discrimination.
27. What can we infer from the first three paragraphs?
 In both East and West, names are essential to success.
 The alphabet is to blame for the failure of ZoëZysman.
 Customers often pay a lot of attention to companies’ names.  Some form of discrimination is too subtle to recognize.
28. The 4th paragraph suggests that   .
 questions are often put to the more intelligent students
 alphabetically disadvantaged students often escape from class  teachers should pay attention to all of their students
 students should be seated according to their eyesight
29. What does the author mean by “most people are literally having a ZZZ” (Lines 2-3, Paragraph 5)?
 They are getting impatient.
 They are noisily dozing off.
 They are feeling humiliated.
 They are busy with word puzzles.
30. Which of the following is true according to the text?
 People with surnames beginning with N to Z are often ill-treated.  VIPs in the Western world gain a great deal from alphabetism.  The campaign to eliminate alphabetism still has a long way to go.  Putting things alphabetically may lead to unintentional bias.

When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn't biting her nails just yet. But the
47-year-old manicurist isn't cutting, filing or polishing as many nails as she'd like to, either. Most of her clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped
 
 
showing up. Spero blames the softening economy. “I'm a good economic indicator,” she says. “I provide a service that people can do without when they're concerned about saving some dollars.” So Spero is downscaling, shopping at middle-brow Dillard's department store near her suburban Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. “I don't know if other clients are going to abandon me, too,” she says.
Even before Alan Greenspan's admission that America's red-hot economy is cooling, lots of working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car dealerships to Gap outlets, sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For retailers, who last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cautious approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last year's pace. But don't sound any alarms just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the economy's long-term prospects even as they do some modest belt-tightening.
Consumers say they're not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own fortunes still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, “there's a new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed by Wall Street bonuses,” says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still rising even as frenzied overbidding quiets. “Instead of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three," says John Tealdi, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their ability to find and keep a job.
Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home buyers would cheer for lower interest rates. Employers wouldn't mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. Many consumers seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now view as a necessary ingredient to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, too. Getting a table at Manhattan's hot new Alain Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co. may still be worth toasting.
31. By “Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet” (Line 1, Paragraph 1), the author means_____.  Spero can hardly maintain her business.
 Spero is too much engaged in her work.
 Spero has grown out of her bad habit.
 Spero is not in a desperate situation.
32. How do the public feel about the current economic situation?
 Optimistic.  Confused.  Carefree.  Panicked.
33. When mentioning “the $4 million to $10 million range”(Lines 3, Paragraph 3), the author is talking about _______
 gold market.
 real estate.
 stock exchange.
 venture investment.
34. Why can many people see “silver linings” to the economic slowdown?
 They would benefit in certain ways.
 The stock market shows signs of recovery.  Such a slowdown usually precedes a boom.
 
 
 The purchasing power would be enhanced.
35. To which of the following is the author likely to agree?
 A new boom, on the horizon.
 Tighten the belt, the single remedy.  Caution all right, panic not.
 The more ventures, the more chances.

Americans today don't place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes, entertainers, and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our children to get a practical education—not to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Symptoms of pervasive anti-intellectualism in our schools aren't difficult to find.
“Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than intellectual,” says education writer Diane Ravitch. “Schools could be a counterbalance.” Ravitch's latest book. Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms, traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the American distaste for intellectual pursuits.
But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind leaves them vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend their ideas and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. Continuing along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, “We will become a second-rate country. We will have a less civil society.”
“Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,” writes historian and professor Richard Hofstadter in Anti-intellectualism in American Life, a Pulitzer-Prize winning book on the roots of anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the beginning of our history, says Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything that smells of elitism. Practicality, common sense, and native intelligence have been considered more noble qualities than anything you could learn from a book.
Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and rigorous book learning put unnatural restraints on children: “We are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing.”Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn exemplified American anti-intellectualism. Its hero avoids being civilized—going to school and learning to read—so he can preserve his innate goodness.
Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we reluctantly admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the mind. Intelligence seeks to grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes, and imagines.
School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country's educational system is in the grips of people who “joyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility to intellect and their eagerness to identify with children who show the least intellectual promise.”
36. What do American parents expect their children to acquire in school?
 
 
 The habit of thinking independently.  Profound knowledge of the world.
 Practical abilities for future career.
 The confidence in intellectual pursuits.
37. We can learn from the text that Americans have a history of________.  undervaluing intellect.
 favoring intellectualism.
 supporting school reform.
 suppressing native intelligence.
38. The views of Raviteh and Emerson on schooling are ______.
 identical.  similar.  complementary.  opposite. 39. Emerson, according to the text, is probably _________.
 a pioneer of education reform.  an opponent of intellectualism.  a scholar in favor of intellect.  an advocate of regular schooling.
40. What does the author think of intellect?  It is second to intelligence.
 It evolves from common sense.  It is to be pursued.
 It underlies power
